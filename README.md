# Zulip chat archives for Changelog.com

This repository holds the chat archives for Changelog Media's Zulip Cloud
organization containing all the public channels' messages, maintained as
a community effort and is not affliated with the Changelog team.[^1]

[^1]: if you like to take over the maintenance of this repo, just reach out to @ajhalili2006
on Zulip or email `ajhalili2006@crew.recaptime.dev`.

## Behind the scenes

The `zulip-archive` workflow uses a dedicated service account under the email
address `chat-archives-bot@changelog.zulipchat.com` (it's a generic bot by the
way) instead of using my personal account there for calling Zulip APIs.

As a Community Lorebooks-hosted project, the HTML generated archive is accessible at
<https://changelog.zulip-archive.lorebooks.wiki> via GitHub Pages.
