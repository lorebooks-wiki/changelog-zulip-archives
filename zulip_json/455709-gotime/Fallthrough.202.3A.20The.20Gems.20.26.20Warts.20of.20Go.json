Sometimes I look at the source code of the lib and guess what, they aren't using it either, they only want me to pass in a context because they have to pass it in to some call in the std lib.</p>\n<p>No enums. Honestly WTF is this about. It seems like a petty childish thing to leave out of a language for no reason. Just give me enums already.</p>\n<p>You don't have to assign the return variable if all you are returning it an error. Why does this code even compile let alone run without errors? <a href=\"https://go.dev/play/p/UKxcLnmpoJP\">https://go.dev/play/p/UKxcLnmpoJP</a> </p>\n<p>Similarly you don't have to handle errors and from what I can see 90% of the time nobody handles errors. They just pass it up the chain. Why not make this 90% use case more convenient and less verbose for the programmers.</p>\n<p>Package management is far inferior to languages like ruby and java or whatever.  There are many reasons I won't go into but it's really a pain to pin to particular versions of libraries, only include packages in certain environments etc. </p>\n<p>The new iterators are like nails on a chalkboard for anybody who has ever used a language with proper iterators. Why go team? Why did you do this to us? Why not just have map and fold and whatnot like every other damned language?</p>\n<p>Strict tags should be first class language feature so you don't have to put everything into a giant string, you should be able to put inspectable metadata tags on any element of the struct and the struct itself for that matter. This would also be super handy for generating documentation.</p>\n<p>It should be much easier to manage different environments in go. </p>\n<p>I could go and on but let me end with this.</p>\n<p>Go devs should really just admit that go is an object oriented language and embedding structs is no different than inheritance and that packages are just modules with their module level variables and constructors and such.</p>\n<p>I have some gems too but I'll stop while I am unpopular.</p>",
