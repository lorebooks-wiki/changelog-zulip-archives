I know it's not insignificant and you've got busy lives, making that effort all the more meaningful. </p>\n<p>I've really don't know how to segue into this smoothly, but I want to give some feedback while also emphasising it's 1) coming from a place of care and 2) only my opinion <span aria-label=\"shrug\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f937\" role=\"img\" title=\"shrug\">:shrug:</span> </p>\n<p>So, with that said, I feel like this episode took too long to get to the content. I was doing chores around the house as I'm listening, as usual, and I'm like... feels like this intro has been running <em>awhile</em>, so I check my phone. ~20m or ~1/3 of the runtime in and from memory the episode topics haven't been touched yet.</p>\n<p>Maybe next time you could say, 'hey, we kind of waffle for a bit here, if you want to skip to the content then it begins at <em>timestamp</em>'? Or flip it and put it at the end of podcast? I want you to be able to have fun and enjoy making the content, but for me, this episode wasn't working.</p>\n<p>Hope that doesn't come across too harshly, appreciate what you're doing and I'm glad that Ship It is still running. Also this is only one person's opinion, so, keep that in mind <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span></p>",

I also agree with others that the audio production on ShipIt tends to be sporadic, mainly with Autumn's audio. I too listen to podcasts in the car and I often have my wife sleeping on the longer rides and I constantly have to monitor the volume to respond to much louder laughter throughout the episode.</p>",
