I loved the quiz at the end. <br>\nI haven't touched Wasm yet, and this is another push for me towards giving it a shot. <br>\nI also really agreed with David that Rust is just so enjoyable to use. I've used it for the backend of my latest project and couldn't really justify it other than \"I like it!\" Maybe that's all that's needed.</p>",

I'd really like to see what a single-column service looks like. I'm taking a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy\">the github repo</a> but can't see any great example services... maybe <a href=\"https://github.com/RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy/blob/main/projects/rawkode.academy/show-hosts-service/\">this</a> is a good one, which contains the mapping of hosts to shows? I do like the idea of table-per-feature (it reminds me of the ECS structure in video games). But I wonder if all the ceremony around each table is really worth it?<br>\nAaaaanyway I'm at risk of turning this into a microservices argument! Maybe we should try to focus on the specific approach in the episode, which is the use of grafbase, WASM on the backend, etc.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/45f90c694ea360c783176e5ccd395230679d7887/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f656662393763323636313137663132346531653665373830353236386465653264653930626166383530646437363732656363653932323437613866393661342f5261776b6f646541636164656d792f5261776b6f646541636164656d79&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy\" title=\"GitHub - RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy: Rawkode Academy Monorepository\">GitHub - RawkodeAcademy/RawkodeAcademy: Rawkode Academy Monorepository</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Rawkode Academy Monorepository.
