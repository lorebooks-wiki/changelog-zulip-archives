This is still true.</p>\n<p>I heard about this on a security podcast (<a href=\"https://risky.biz\">https://risky.biz</a>) and both I and they agree that it's a very interesting and cool technical demonstration, but very hard to make practical us of.<br>\nAlso, they came back to it a week later after realising that if you need to steal the physical key anyway, why not use that directly instead of extracting the cryptographic key. If you want to cover your tracks, just leave a defective Yubikey of the same model behind and the user will almost certainly assume that it's just broken for some reason.</p>",
