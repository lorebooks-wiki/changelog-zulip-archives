        "content": "<p>This episode was beautiful <span aria-label=\"heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-2764\" role=\"img\" title=\"heart\">:heart:</span> . Many thoughts, but to highlight just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Huge +1 to REPLs and other forms of discovery coding. Both the practice and the terminology. Jimmy credited Brandon Sanderson - he used to be one of the hosts of the <a href=\"https://writingexcuses.com/\">Writing Excuses podcast</a>, and that show continues to regularly have ideas that map well to the dev world.</li>\n<li>On the topic of personal notes / annotations for code, my first experience with that sort of idea was seeing the <a href=\"https://underscorejs.org/docs/underscore-esm.html\">annotated source for underscore.js</a>.</li>\n<li>Tools like VS Code's <a href=\"https://aka.ms/codetour\">Code Tour extension</a> take things to another level though - allowing you to build annotated tours within a repo or export them as self-contained units with stable embedded code snippets. For example, I have a 4 year old tour of a codebase I recorded as part of a workshop. It's a giant json blob in a github gist, which is consumable purely in a browser via <a href=\"http://github.dev\">github.dev</a> for non-VS Code users.<br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/mOR3i7xPqG0BVmCw69rgJNZj/image.png\">image.png</a><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/mOR3i7xPqG0BVmCw69rgJNZj/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"2330x1193\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/66849/mOR3i7xPqG0BVmCw69rgJNZj/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'd be curious what other annotation / tour tools people use.</p>",

Then the tool can extract the full source files out of the document and create your software. Since the document is the main thing and code is what makes the document come alive and inserted with the document, you don't worry about being tagged together.</p>\n<p>You could document your frustrations, personal notes or whatever you wanted.

When are things moving along well and I feel good about my work vs when am I getting really hung up on things.</p>\n<p>Some things that came to mind as I listened to the episode:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coincidentally, I just heard Brandon Sanderson on Tim Ferriss' podcast and was having this same thought about \"outliners\" vs \"discovery\" (Brandon refers to them as \"gardeners\" in the podcast) writers. Really good episode that touches the surface of a lot of things if you're not ready to dive into Brandon's online lectures.</li>\n<li>The idea of \"discovery programming\" is something I've been calling \"rapid prototyping\" for myself (and I definitely prefer it over writing a bunch of docs before I even touch the code). I've found it helpful when there are a lot of unknowns going into planning. Like Mike Tyson said, \"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\" I have felt this similar to how Jimmy mentioned they spent a bunch of time coming up with potential solutions and ended up being none of them.</li>\n<li>A hybrid approach that seems to work well for me is: rapid prototype -&gt; plan -&gt; prod-level code.<ul>\n<li>It seems like you need the rapid prototype to grok the problem/system first (assuming there are unknowns). This doesn't need to be \"clean\" code or a perfect implementation. You're just trying to better understand what's going on and come up with a prototype solution.</li>\n<li>From there, you can come up with a better plan since you've discovered the previous unknowns. And you can fit it into your larger project as a whole (things you already have an understanding of).</li>\n<li>Lastly, you write the code you want to publish. This is where you can implement whatever your \"good practices\" are (TDD, \"clean code\", etc).</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All this to say this was a great episode that got me thinking about my own practices more. Which, inevitably, leads me to enjoying coding more.</p>",

I just don't know them yet <span aria-label=\"sunglasses\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f60e\" role=\"img\" title=\"sunglasses\">:sunglasses:</span> .</p>\n<p>Actually the creator (Jonathan Carter) bundles CodeTour and a bunch of related extensions into <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=codespaces-Contrib.codeswing\">CodeSwing</a> which he calls an \"interactive coding playground\". And he created <a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.gitdoc\">GitDoc</a> separately, which automatically commits/pushes changes as you work.

Then, Jimmy gave the example of when he drafted a design doc and realized that his designs did not make sense. The entire time I thought, maybe we need to talk about better analysis. Then I realized that Discovery Coding is an analysis tool. It is about better analysis. He's adding code that assists in understanding the system so that his future design ideas are more informed. </p>\n<p>Thinking about TDD. I don't see that as a form of analysis. It's an implementation method, writing code to fix a bug or create a new feature. You could design the solution before beginning TDD or as you go, realizing how the thing works as you write acceptance criteria in the form of tests. HOWEVER, writing tests can be done for the sake of analysis. That's not TDD, that's part of the discovery process. It's the same as Jimmy's example of adding debug statements or hacking a REPL so that he can figure things out.</p>\n<p>I think Discovery Coding might be a misnomer, only because when someone says, \"I'm coding\", you imagine that person is fixing a bug or creating a feature. Also, it's important to think about Outlining in the right context. Are we outlining a design or are we outlining the current behavior of the system? If we're comparing Discovery Coding to Design Outlining, then we're comparing apples and oranges.</p>",

Don't just discovery code your way to the final implementation. Give yourself room to think and write down your thoughts and refactor the code. There's nothing worse than a discovery coding implementation that becomes the final production implementation without anything written down describing it. Argue all you want about \"productivity\" but it's really just laziness.</li>\n<li>Use a language that's ripe for prototyping, if applicable. I think Go really shines here with the way it does implicit interface implementation and encourages you to be more concrete with things.</li>\n</ul>",
