They have their own fork that they run.<br>\nVarnish Software has their enterprise Varnish+ that companies can buy to run their own cdn at scale with alot of features that the community does not want to include.<br>\nThe interesting thing here, I think, is that Varnish Cache is not under the direct control of Varnish Software.
