Ecco was head and shoulders above all others in the market IMHO and had a dedicated following. The software was sold to Netmanage in 1997 which then promptly killed it citing the inclusion of microsoft outlook in office for free. They said they can't compete with free software. </p>\n<p>For a long time the community kept trying to use the program but alas without the source not much could be done.   Somebody wrote an app called zoot which was inspired by ecco but to me it just wasn't the same. Ecco had lots of innovative ideas which I haven't seen replicated in any software since. If I was a millionaire I'd hire a team to replicate it just for the hell of it but I don't even think the market for such a thing exists anymore.</p>",
