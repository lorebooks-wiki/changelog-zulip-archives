I see USIT led this round and Eclipse led earlier ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Great question! And, yes, generally. There are exceptions to this, but broadly your investors want to see the company get new outside investment. This forces the company to appeal to outsiders in a way that everyone generally agrees is healthy (not unlike seeking one's doctorate from a different institution as one's undergraduate degree).   Conversely, there can be a stigma associated with an all-insider round:  it may indicate that a company is struggling and in fact dependent on its existing investors to bridge them to the next milestone. Aside from conventional wisdom, there are other mechanical reasons for this, especially in the Series A to Series B transition:  many funds are not truly stage-agnostic, and generally have a sweet spot that they want to be in (e.g. \"early stage\" versus \"growth\"). </p>\n<p>We knew from the beginning that we would be seeking an outside lead for our Series B. We were fortunately able to achieve our ideal outcome: a big, outside lead coupled with participation by all current investors.</p>",
