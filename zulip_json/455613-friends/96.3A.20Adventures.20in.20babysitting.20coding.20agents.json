At one point Steve says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“they're submitting double digits more PRs per time unit than their colleagues who aren't using agentic coding. Now, the AI submitted PRs, they get turned back more often, but the ones that are making it through are dwarfing the work of the people who are doing it by hand.

(I can also push loads of garbage PRs with high-rejected rates, if that is metric :) But secondly, who is reviewing all these PRs? Once changes are merged, who is validating new features?  As long as humans are reviewing code (which I hope is a long time), and as long as there are other steps in the SDLC (QA, feature-flag rollout, A/B testing, user feedback, deciding where to iterate, etc), it seems like the bottleneck will just be shifted right. So having LLMs push lines of code 24/7 is only going to take productivity so far if the metric is not just LOCs written, but useful features shipped. This is another instance where toy projects, POCs, and demos are categorically different than real-world production grade software with multiple stakeholders and change-management processes.</p>",

I've always been eager to learn, and I understand that it's part of my job to keep current with latest tech (whether it's new languages+frameworks, cloud architectures, devops practices, or just parts of the stack outside my current expertise).  And most engineers I know are very interested in learning. Maybe it's different in some niche positions at big-tech—Ive haven't observed that <span aria-label=\"man shrugging\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f937-200d-2642\" role=\"img\" title=\"man shrugging\">:man_shrugging:</span> </p>\n<p>For me, the skepticism/apprehension is due to the huge gap between the Hype+Narrative of AI and the reality on the ground. For 3 years the narrative has been that AI will continue to get exponentially better, and at best it's a silver bullet for every tech company to increase productivity, at worst it will replace all engineers and white collar jobs. Underpinning this is usually a claim about AGI being right around the corner.</p>\n<p>The Reality is that it's a really powerful tool, but nowhere near those claims. But if you point that out, the retort is always, \"yes but it will be in [6/12/24] months when the next model drops because look at how much it's improved.\" </p>\n<p>It's unclear to me if AI will continue to improve or plateau. At the very least, it's NOT a guarantee that just because something increased for the first few years, it will continue to do so. (a) we've already trained on all the data, so now it's relying on generated data, which seems problematic (tho I'm not an expert here). And (b) there may just be fundamental limits to the LLM architecture, or practical limits like power consumption, data center size etc required to actually get to an \"AGI\".</p>\n<p>What IS clear to me is how every tech C-Suite and investor seems more influence by the Narrative regardless of the Reality. They seem to be drooling at the mouth for a future where they can fire 90% of their staff, which, I suppose shouldn't be surprising, but is also quite disappointing and jarring, especially for folks driven to tech for the supposed job security. </p>\n<p>The closed-door conversation between Steve and Dario referenced in this episode sounds like they believe this stuff is going to lead to a quite dire future. We <em>should</em> be optimistic about new tech, and the fact that it always feels so dystopian I think is because the Narrative. So we're going to destroy society so a handful of companies can make trillions of dollars?</p>\n<p>If the narrative is true, then what are we even doing? I shouldn't be learning Claude Code, I should be getting my plumbers license or building a bunker. If the Narrative is false, it almost doesn't matter, because it seems the Narrative itself is driving a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/25/business/amazon-ai-coders.html\">lot</a> of <a href=\"https://pluralistic.net/2025/04/27/some-animals/#are-more-equal-than-others\">changes</a> in the industry. </p>\n<p>Anyway, I use AI every day as a tool. It helps with a lot of things. I wouldn't trust it to push production without thorough review. And I'm still not sure if it's more efficient (long or short term) to babysit agents, which means spending all my time reviewing code vs just coding the thing myself, which is not perfect, but at least I know the approach is valid and comprehensible. </p>\n<p><a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/h5rqRGC2BsojGLe2WfuyI_cs/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\n<a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/NnSxRXDWkRu8wbelqxUJ6Gku/image.png\">image.png</a><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://www.goodtechthings.com/\">https://www.goodtechthings.com/</a></p>\n<div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/h5rqRGC2BsojGLe2WfuyI_cs/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1920x1920\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/66849/h5rqRGC2BsojGLe2WfuyI_cs/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div><div class=\"message_inline_image\"><a href=\"/user_uploads/66849/NnSxRXDWkRu8wbelqxUJ6Gku/image.png\" title=\"image.png\"><img data-original-content-type=\"image/png\" data-original-dimensions=\"1262x1262\" src=\"/user_uploads/thumbnail/66849/NnSxRXDWkRu8wbelqxUJ6Gku/image.png/840x560.webp\"></a></div>",

Instead of developers having to manage the steps (what would this look like, make a plan for this, do step 1, do step 2, etc...), the platform will do this for you and manage the agents behind the scenes.</p>",
