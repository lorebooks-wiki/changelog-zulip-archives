I didn’t know you helped produce Grafana’s Big Tent. I heard it referenced somewhere and have listened to a few episode and enjoyed it, great job! I’m interested in what other friends you might be working with to help produce for, that’s cool. I enjoyed hearing about how the sausage gets made, and I think its interesting to get a peak behind the curtain and hear more about some of the difficult parts, and where you have found ways to improve the process along the journey. Thanks</p>",
