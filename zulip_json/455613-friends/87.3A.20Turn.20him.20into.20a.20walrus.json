Some folks who do ads on Changelog seem to try to cram as much in as they can and it’s not a conversation at all. Those ones are far less compelling than ads that have a good back-and-forth conversation, something that I have only heard on Changelog.</p>",

They were over explaining the features or whatever.</p>\n<p>What I like about the conversational ads is I can skip them when I already heard it before. Like I've heard from David at Retool already so I'm well aware of the person and product. Skip! When I hear new people I listen again.</p>\n<p>I don't always skip but knowing the person and product helps when I want to skip.</p>",
