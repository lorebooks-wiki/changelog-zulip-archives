From the fact that god lied when he told them they would die on the day they ate the fruit and the serpent told them the truth when he said he said god was lying to the fact that immortality was within reach for humanity and prevented with swinging flaming swords at the east border of the garden (the garden apparently has borders!)</p>\n<p>Anyway it's a funny origin story.</p>",

God told them they could eat the fruit of any tree except the tree of knowledge. He didn't mention the tree of life which means if they did eat from that tree they would be immortal. He also prevented them from eating the fruit of tree of life despite not telling them not to eat it.</p>\n<p>Like I said it's a funny origin story. </p>\n<p>My favorite origin story is the one where many universes are created every time Mahavishnu exhales.  Each universe is created, exists for a certain period of time, and is then destroyed, only to be recreated again in an endless cycle. </p>\n<p>Kind of cool to have a multiverse origin story and the breathing cycle of mahavishnu is the age of the universe.</p>",

But a few years ago I was working building varnish vmods and all the tests was made using VTC. I found that the collection of tests from the varnish-cache source code was the best source of information. <a href=\"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/tree/master/bin/varnishtest/tests\">https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/tree/master/bin/varnishtest/tests</a></p>\n<p>Most test has the vcl inline in the test but you can also include vcl files as shown in <a href=\"https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/blob/master/bin/varnishtest/tests/v00046.vtc\">https://github.com/varnishcache/varnish-cache/blob/master/bin/varnishtest/tests/v00046.vtc</a></p>",
