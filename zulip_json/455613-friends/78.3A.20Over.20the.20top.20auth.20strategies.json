They have a browser extension that allows you to you to have autofill and submit for 2FA codes. The flow is activate the extension, a push notification is sent to your phone, you authenticate with biometrics on that device and the code is auto filled for you. It is also smart enough to send you the next code is the current one is about to expire. <span aria-label=\"+1\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f44d\" role=\"img\" title=\"+1\">:+1:</span> Good stuff <a href=\"https://2fas.com/\">https://2fas.com/</a></p>",
