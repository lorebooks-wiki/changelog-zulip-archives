Granted just knowing how the transmission/gearbox works doesn’t automatically mean you know how an engine works, but I guess there’s a parallel there with code and high level vs low level. </p>\n<p>I love AI for the reduction in mental overhead. The amount of times it has unblocked me when I’m tired from being up with kids the previous night or just generally not feeling my best is insane and worth every penny. But to lose the control over the entire codebase and give up my ability to understand and code so the AI can take over feels like a level of control I’m personally not ready to give up, and until I see more than a 10% increase in productivity from actual studies I’ll be sticking to the way I currently use it. 10% really isn’t worth it for me just yet.</p>",

After that time, many participants reported difficulty readjusting to work without AI assistance—particularly those with disabilities who had come to rely on the accessibility benefits. The department hasn't announced the next steps, leaving users in limbo. When participants report difficulty readjusting to work without AI while productivity gains remain marginal, accessibility emerges as potentially the first AI application with irreplaceable value.</p>\n</blockquote>",
