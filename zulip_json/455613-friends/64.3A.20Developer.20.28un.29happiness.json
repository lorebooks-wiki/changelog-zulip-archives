My wife used to work part time  for an NGO as an at home tutor for children with severe mental or physical difficulties. These children could not attend school and my wife would visit them at home once a week to go over their homework and to help them with their struggles.  Often these kids would be hostile due to either physical pain or frustration or anger so her job was quite difficult at times. To add insult to injury not only was she paid almost nothing but was not compensated for the use of her vehicle and certainly not for the numerous treats or supplies she would provide for the children. </p>\n<p>It occurred me one day that I got paid more by lunch time than she did for an entire month of work.  I asked her why she put up with it and she said her only goal was to make the life of the child more pleasant for one hour. She didn't expect anything else, that was enough for her to keep going. </p>\n<p>I spent my whole day working so that some company could sell more shitty product to more consumers who probably didn't need the thing anyway.  I don't think having a faster CI or better pull requests would have made me more happy in that job.   </p>\n<p>I bet a lot of devs are in similar circumstances, maybe even 80%</p>",

But in general losing benefits or salary feels worse than never having them... So I think that adds to it, too.</p>\n<p>There's also a weird dissonance of being told you're a shareholder and have a stake in the company, and then having no actual input into decisions and getting laid off the next week like it's nothing. It almost feels like gaslighting. </p>\n<p>But I just heard a great quote on Silicon Valley to back up your point: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Richard: Ok, I'll talk to my guys about it, but they won't be happy. <br>\nAction Jack: Of course not, Richard. They're engineers.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I understand that some people are being told they can no longer work remotely and I guess that's a loss of benefit but my experience is that devs get a raise every time they change jobs and indeed it's one of the greatest benefits of the job is that you can easily hop between jobs.  </p>\n<p>As for being a shareholder I think that's the curse of the stock options.  I never worked for stock options myself. If somebody offered pay + stock options then OK but I would try to negotiate actual vested stock or a short timeline for vesting or even revenue/profit sharing depending on the situation. If I thought I would help the company increase their profits then I'll take stock or profit share as a part of my compensation. If it's a huge company and I'll have minimal or no impact then that's a different story.</p>\n<p>I have been living in New Zealand for the last twenty years or so and over here we don't have to worry too much about other benefits such as health insurance or vacation time and such. Vacation and sick leave are regulated by the government and there is universal health care coverage.</p>",

        "content": "<blockquote>\n<p>Are people losing benefits and salaries though?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I brought up those examples because they're top of mind.. at my company we've just been told that our benefits are getting worse (going to have to pay a lot more for insurance) and our pay bands just went down. In our case that doesn't change current salary, but if you're about to get promoted, for example, you might get basically no raise. Hearing similar things from other as well... And many of my friends who got laid off at my last job (along with me) had to settle for a lower salary. So they aren't necessarily excited for their new job, which I think leads to the huge amount of complacency in this survey.</p>\n<p>I'm with you on stock, but it's standard at tech companies here in the US. I actually asked for as much base salary as possible vs. stock in all my jobs. I'd much rather have the sure thing. But with how recruiters and executives talk about stock, I think a lot of newer-in-career folks think it's going to be a huge windfall for them at some point. I'm much more jaded in that sense. They're also only actually liquid and worth something if the company is public (or gets acquired - sometimes).</p>\n<p>NZ - Ah yeah, I'm a little jealous. I would love to not have employment tied to insurance... <span aria-label=\"slight frown\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f641\" role=\"img\" title=\"slight frown\">:slight_frown:</span></p>",
