Someone else in the community recommended Tabnine so I was planning on giving that a spin over the weekend. I've been using Sourcegraph Cody to mixed success and now that they rug pulled I'm on the look out for something new, was even thinking about trying to run some local models via Ollama to see how that goes but the variety of models available to self-host are fewer. From looking at Augment Code's docs I'm intrigued.  I've found for Typescript, PHP, etc most of the models do just fine but thus far for Rust none of them are good.</p>",
