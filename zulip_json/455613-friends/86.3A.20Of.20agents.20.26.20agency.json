Something I’ve thought about is how my team and I are already nearly at a bottleneck given how much code we have to review. If 10 more code reviews came in each day because we are all just chucking out vide code, who’s gonna review all that? I suppose there might be a future where we are okay with AI agents reviewing AI generated code… sort of like what Jerod was saying about LLMs checking LLMs for hallucinations… and that is an interesting future to consider. </p>\n<p>One thing I’d be all for an AI agent helping me out with, though, is doing my debugging for me. I’d love to be able say “here’s the problem I’m having, go take the whole code base as your context, go interact with the app in the browser, do whatever you need to do, and give me a summary of what the bug is while I have a cup of coffee.”</p>",

Something along the lines of rocq (coq) which is a language that is provable.  The AI will write the code and then run the compiler which will error out if it's not provable. The language I envision will also include things like fuzz testing and such so that when the AI writes the code it will also write a full test suite which passes.</p>\n<p>If this language is sufficiently concise and easily readable like ruby then all you have to do is check the business logic and you can be assured the rest of the code is solid.</p>\n<p>The next step after that will be to create a language incomprehensible to humans but safe and easy for the AI <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>",
