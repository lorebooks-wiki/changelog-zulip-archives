I agree that it's generally a waste of time to rice your setup instead of just using the dang thing. However, I think a lot of people don't take the 20% of time up front to learn the basics of the tools they are using. Then they complain on the internet that the tool \"wasn't for them\" or \"sucks\" and that they will \"build a modern tool that's better\". If you just spent even 5 minutes learning the tool you'd realize it doesn't suck and it does meet your needs.</p>",

I remember this in pool where having a $500 stick doesn't magically make you better at pool but once you're at a certain level of skill it does help. I can pick up a bar stick and beat most people in pool since I know the fundamentals well. Same thing with my profession. I can use <code>vi</code> without syntax highlighting and AI to edit files and put out good work if necessary but of course I'd rather use my normal setup. I'm not lost like some of the new people in this field that take the day off when ChatGPT is down.</p>",

To me the conversation was a back and forth on what things have you or have you not changed your mind about? Topics like tooling came up and the hosts answered from their perspectives but it's not like these topics are \"solved\" by any means. Every person has their own opinion on these topics and it's good to hear others to better refine yours. If I had to guess I'd say that you already formed your opinions on the topics discussed so you didn't find value in the discussion.</p>",

I believe the origins of this phrase begins with the Latin \"Festina Lente\" used by the Roman Navy. Translates to \"make haste slowly\".  I haven't ever heard it applied to software development however.

Read the following with a diesel-soaked mechanic version of Tintin's Captain Haddock not-for-company vocabulary.  <em>\"You boys have your pedal down all the time, then have to brake and overcorrect. Your sister get's it right. Slow down going into the corner, then smoothly accelerate throughout the turn.\"</em> </p>\n<p>In a similar vein: <em>\"you dumb kids think the way to use four-wheel drive is to get off the highway, lock up the hubs and go for broke. The right way is to go down that back road until you get in a tight spot, then use four-by to get out and go home. What you're gonna do: not listen to me, get stuck way the hell out there, and walk out.\"</em>  </p>\n<p>He nailed it. (Hella fun though, even with the 2,3, and 7 hour hikes depending on which event we're celebrating. Also expensive. Took me 5 years to pay off the 7hr one.)</p>\n<p>The slow down to go fast refrain echoes through my mind recurringly still, in widely varying contexts.
