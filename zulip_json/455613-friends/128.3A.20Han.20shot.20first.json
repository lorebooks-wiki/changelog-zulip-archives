        "content": "<p>Boy you guys really tap danced around the AI elephant on this episode. Consider these thoughts.</p>\n<p>What's to stop anybody from using David Attenborough's voice to say anything they want? Say there is a company wanting to get a permit to mine an area which would threaten an endangered species. They can make a documentary using David's voice telling people how this creature is a threat and should be eliminated. Perhaps the documentary can be about how open pit mining is wonderful for the environment and diversity of life.</p>\n<p>The Trump administration published an AI generated picture of a black woman crying while being arrested. The mainstream media and social media happily propagated this image world wide and she was absolutely powerless to stop it. The republicans either approved of it or excused it or just didn't care.  Nobody did anything which means they are going to keep doing it and maybe amp it up.</p>\n<p>Imagine the next time ICE kills a protester they make a fake video of that person pulling a gun out. Imagine them making a video of a political opponent making plans for a terrorist attack or denouncing Jesus or whatever is going to trigger the voters. </p>\n<p>Who is going to stop them?  From the crying image incidence we know how utterly gullible the voting population is. They believe anything they see on facebook or television. Even if the television pundit makes noises saying something like \"we haven't confirmed if this image is real\" (which is a lie of course) they just ignore the weasel words and believe what they want to believe.</p>\n<p>We are in for some dark times. People are going to be jailed for things they never did because the government produced a video of them committing the crime. People are going to executed because somebody believed they were molesting children in a pizza parlor. Ooops I guess that already happened before AI but it will happen much more often in the future.</p>",
