It's cheap for 50 gigs. I also store my documents folder there.  </p>\n<p>I also looked into <a href=\"http://rsync.net\">rsync.net</a> for a little while but they have a 800GB minimum buy and I didn't want to pay that.</p>\n<p>Recently I also looked at syncthing but AFIK it does not have a mobile client. </p>\n<p>I am about to look into self hosted options such as nextcloud and jellyfin to see what they are like but no matter what I will need to pay apple for my storage because of the iphone backup situation.</p>",
