I met him back around 2006-08 when I was moving my first job over Radiant (from an extremely hacky PHP3 homegrown code base that I wouldn't even call a CMS).</p>\n<p>I took a train down to a Hackathon he (I think) hosted down in Cary (or one of those other NC tech towns). Loved Radiant. It was well designed, had a powerful tagging language, and was easy to extend. No idea if the company is still using it (and a little afraid to ask). But we went from a workflow where researchers would do data entry in FileMaker and then would have to double write everything in Word + InDesign for print and HTML for web down to a single flow and I was pretty proud of that (and grateful for what Radiant did to get me there).</p>",
