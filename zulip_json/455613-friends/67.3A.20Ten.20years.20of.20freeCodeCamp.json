That's impossible anyways with my family and job, and I'm sure many others are in that situation. If it's only new grads or self taught folks who aren't yet employed who have the cert, I feel like it might not mean as much to employers.</p>\n<p>A certification like PMP from the PMI (mentioned in the episode) is largely focused on hands-on work at a job. I wonder if we could do something similar....</p>",

It was seen as a necessary requirement for getting a decent job. I did go and drop out, then I went back and dropped out again because it wasn't for me.  Not having a degree meant that I could not get a lot of jobs so I ended up going the enterpreneur route which did work out for me but I don't think it's for everybody. </p>\n<p>During my time in school the things I valued most were not related to computers (my major) but the science and literature and philosophy I was exposed to and of course hanging out with poetry majors and architecture students and physics and mathematics majors. My favorite teacher was my abstract algebra teacher and I can honestly say my mind was blown by that class. Something I have never and will never use in real life but still expanded my mind more than all the chemicals people experiment with.</p>",
