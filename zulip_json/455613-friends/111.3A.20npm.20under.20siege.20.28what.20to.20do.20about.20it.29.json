One is a manifest/descriptor second is the actual zip file. </li>\n<li>The manifest is a json or yaml or whatever which contains the package, info, deps, and metadata about the package. It's designed to be plaintext and indexable. Can be served from an https url or IPFS. You host it on your own domain. </li>\n<li>The manifest contains the hash of the package (zip file) which you can use to retrieve from the distributed store.</li>\n<li>The package contains the manifest (except the hash of course) which you can verify against the index to ensure you have the right package.</li>\n<li>If the package contains source code a search is done of the source code and a prompt is created which details whether or not the code is accessing the file system, what directories it's seeking, what URL's it's reaching out to etc.  Needless to say this has to be language specific.</li>\n<li>Packages can be signed.

Step 6 is basically code review. If code can be examined then we can isolate certain system calls such as file io, network access etc and present a report the user saying \"this package contacts the URL xyz\" or \"this package attempts to open a file in directory xyz\" etc.  Step seven can ensure trust by checking a signature. </p>\n<p>In my scenario packages are urls. <a href=\"http://microsoft.com/os/some_package/2.1.3\">http://microsoft.com/os/some_package/2.1.3</a> for example. Each version would be a unique URL. If the URL is an IPFS url or a namecoin URL or something like that then it's immutable which is even better.  When you pull up that URL you get a manifest you can examine which details the author, package version, dependencies, public keys etc.  In it there is an entry which is the hash of the zip file. You pull up the zip file using the hash from ipfs or freenet. You can then open the zip file and compare the manifest inside of it with the manifest you pulled to ensure you are getting the right version of the software. </p>\n<p>As you pointed out it's not perfect in that people could camp on domain misspellings, post malicious binaries, etc. I guess for that we need additional layer of protections from the OS like requiring permissions before accessing external directories, pausing apps that consume too much CPU, etc.</p>",
