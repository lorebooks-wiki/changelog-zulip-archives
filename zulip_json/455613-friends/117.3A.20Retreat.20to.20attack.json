I would also be interested in Meshtastic.  I don't directly know anybody that works on that project, but a few years ago, I was on the PhD Thesis committee for a student working in that space (e.g. LoRA on inexpensive radios and applications of that design). I am happy to connect the changelog crew (or anyone else in this community) with him (just DM me).  His PhD work was super cool.  Checkout his <a href=\"https://www.montana.edu/calendar/events/48339\">defense abstract</a> for more info.</p>",

That said, the MeshCore folks still think meshtastic has its uses particularly for like a group of people going hiking with no service. MeshCore is built for dense mesh while Meshtastic is built for sparse mesh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From what I can tell, Meshtastic is mostly for sending telemetry and battery levels around while not being able to send DMs anywhere</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Well, for meshtastic something like 90% of traffic is automated</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meshtastic also had some exploits found with during blackhat (one fix: <a href=\"https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/commit/f2b935f48f9412a1e3bebe8d37a757311655a85e\">https://github.com/meshtastic/firmware/commit/f2b935f48f9412a1e3bebe8d37a757311655a85e</a>). I think MeshCore is more friendly onboarding and supports more hops across the network</p>\n<p>That being said, it depends on what's around you for meshes as well, and there are communities supporting both (Boston Mesh has both Mesh{Core,tastic})</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"750170\">@Jerod Santo</span> and neither are really \"running IP over radio\" (listening to how you and Adam were talking about it on the episode) :D</p>",
