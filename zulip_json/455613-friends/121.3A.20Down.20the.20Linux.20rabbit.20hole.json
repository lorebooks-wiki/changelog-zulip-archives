It takes a moment to get used to the immutable system dirs, but there are still persistent directories for config and data. I mentally mapped it to a docker container with a few host mounts. One you get that, I found it quite useful.<br>\nI actually run a small VPS on hetzner with a fedora bootc image to host 2 small web projects. Flow-wise I create a Dockerfile based of the bootc image. From there I install a basic set of tooling including docker and tailscale. I know... podman should be preferable but I fully agree with Alex... the little things like user mappings or things work slightly different than docker can be annoying... so I just stay with docker most of the time. <br>\nThe bootc image is rebuild via github actions once per weak or when I merge something and pushed to dockerhub.</p>\n<p>On the hetzner vps I installed fedora I believe and than ran a command to take over the host disk with bootc. I configured credentials for dockerhub and which image to pick and after a reboot it was online.<br>\nThe image itself checks once per day for an update and reboots into it if necessary. </p>\n<p>My frequently changing workload is deployed over my ci server via tailscale to the vm using simple docker compose.</p>\n<p>Overall, the host is mostly hands-off after setup. If things don't work, I see it in GitHub actions before they go live, e.g. Fedora 44 is not supported by tailscale yet. Renovate proposed it, ci failed, so it never went into prod. The bootc mechanism shines especially if you manage a fleet of devices. Build once, deploy many times.</p>\n<p>But <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"750017\">@Adam Stacoviak</span> definitively fun topic to tinker with, feel free to reach out, if you need some help somewhere.</p>",

        "content": "<p><code>bootc</code> is definitely very cool, particularly for anyone who wishes building VMs could be more like a container. Like I said before, I've been running Bluefin for a bit and I really haven't customized the immutable OS at all. But I haven't felt the need to either. I've only installed utilities through <code>brew</code> and Snap (which are installed outside of the OS) and I do all of my development in distrobox (mostly using Debian containers ironically) or QEMU VMs.</p>\n<p>But I think it's worth messing around with making your own uBlue derivative (which itself is derived from Fedora) just to see how it's done. uBlue has <a href=\"https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template\">a starter template that you just have to fork</a> along with <a href=\"https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template\">a tutorial video</a>.</p>",
