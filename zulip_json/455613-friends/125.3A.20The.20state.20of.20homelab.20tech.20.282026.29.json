From unleashing Claude on your UDM Pro to building custom Proxmox CLIs, they explores how AI is transforming what's possible in the homelab. Tim declares 2026 the \"Year of Self-Hosted Software\" while Adam reveals his homelab's secret weapons: DNSHole (a Pi-hole replacement written in Rust) and PXM (a Proxmox automation CLI). <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.am/125\">https://changelog.am/125</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ch</th>\n<th>Start</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Runs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.am/125#t=0\">00:00</a></td>\n<td>Let's talk!</td>\n<td>00:42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.am/125#t=42\">00:42</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://depot.dev\">Sponsor: Depot</a></td>\n<td>02:21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.am/125#t=184\">03:04</a></td>\n<td>New year.

I bought a new iphone and restored it from a backup of my old phone (which I still have) just to find out none of my music came in. Now I have to figure out how to get my music into my new phone.  All of this music was ripped from my CDs which means I do have copies of them in storage (i have long replaced the macbook air they were originally in).  Now I am considering hosting my own music service or something like that. I need to look into the options but it looks like I need to create a music server and use tailscale or forward a port or something.   Maybe there is some client that can download all the files when I am on wifi so I can listen to them when I am not at home without exposing my home PC.</p>\n<p>Another option might be some sort of a multi master replicated file storage and some app that can act as a music player.  Maybe syncthing + something else.  I already use MEGA to sync files so maybe that's an option too but that defeats the purpose of homelabbing.</p>",
