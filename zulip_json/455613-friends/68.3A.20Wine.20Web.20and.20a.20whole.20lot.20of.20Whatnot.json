If I see that a comedian tells a joke that I consider is harmful to me or somebody I love I use my right of free association to not buy any of his output. I use my right of free speech to urge others to do the same.</p>\n<p>If your boss fires you because you told a joke than it's obvious your boss also thinks what you did was gross and doesn't want any of that taint on the company. In the US workers have no rights so your boss can fire your for any reason. </p>\n<p>On the other side of the coin you have actual government actions that get people fired or deported or jailed. Those are the things you should be actually worried about.  Elon willy nilly firing tens of thousands of people, people being deported because they protested Israel, people being beaten by cops because they were near a protest, people being run over because they were at a protest etc are all much much worse than people using their right of free speech on the internet to point out their disgust at a \"joke\".</p>",
