There are lots of those types of stories about China and that's not by accident. </p>\n<p>I find it odd that you would refer to Xi Jinping as a man baby prone to tantrums. I have never heard of anything he said that could be labeled as a tantrum. Granted I haven't seen him speak much but from what I have seen he always seems very measured in his speech both in style and content.  Trump OTOH is basically insane as far as I can tell. He can't even string together a coherent sentence that doesn't contradict himself and keeps ping ponging from day to day. </p>\n<p>Anyway yes you are the product. Your data is being delivered to five eyes + Israel no matter what you say. Some of your data may also be ending up in China or Russia or maybe even some other country. The fear for me isn't \"who has my data\" the fear is \"who can use my data to harm me\".  As a Kiwi that entity is the USA and the rest of the countries in five eyes + Israel group. For example if I say something about Xi and he somehow decides to take action I am confident my government would not hand me over to China to be prosecuted. If Elon or Zuck or Trump decided I needed to be taught a lesson my country would happily hand me over to the USA to do with me as they will.</p>\n<p>This is why I fear facebook, xitter, reddit, and other US based social media more than I fear China.</p>",

You may want to look that up if you are not familiar with the case but the whole affair was shameful and illegal under NZ law but it was done anyway. </p>\n<p>I don't know how the average person lives in China but I do have lots of friends and family in the USA and the average person seems utterly miserable there.  There is  constant worry of being bankrupted by the next health event or car failure or whatever. Seems like even the middle class is barely hanging on and as a result they live a life of stress and angst. This has to be debilitating for your mental health especially if you have kids. </p>\n<p>I decided to leave the US when Bush got re-elected. Best decision I ever made.  NZ is a relatively poor country but life here is a lot less stressful. I did spend a lot of time in AU though and I love Melbourne and Perth. The only thing about AU that I don't like are the bugs and the fact that everything is poisonous and wants to kill you <span aria-label=\"grinning\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f600\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning\">:grinning:</span></p>",
