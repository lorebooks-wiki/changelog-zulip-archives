        "content": "<p>This was a very interesting episode and it's clear that Bruce has thought deeply on the subject but I think you guys kind of glossed over the role of AI in the social media feeds. I would argue that the twitter and facebook feeds are the biggest causes of faltering democracy across the world. By pushing people into bubbles and censoring/amplifying what they are allowed to see they radicalized hundreds of millions of people across the world and gave birth to extremist parties and movements.</p>\n<p>There was a spate of stories today about how facebook and TikTok are censoring topics and people who are reporting on things ICE is doing or critical of Israel or critical of Trump or MAGA or anybody peripherally associated with them.  This is only going to get worse as media gets consolidated into the hands of one or two people who themselves are batcrap insane in every way imaginable.</p>\n<p>Of course we shouldn't discount the fact that most people are just so easily manipulated. None of this would work if people were not gullible. I heard an interview with a soybean farmer bemoaning the collapse of the market. He kept saying \"I don't know what's going on but somebody messed up\" and similar insane things. It's as if he had no idea who was buying his soybeans and why they weren't buying them anymore and what happened to the trade between between US and the rest of the world. No idea that the tariffs and the trade was even happening let alone who was responsible for it or what his previous customers were doing to get their soybean needs filled.</p>\n<p>Elon and others talk of existential threat to humanity to humanity from AI and when they do they are imagining some super AI in the future. Nope. It's happening now. People are being made dumber, they are being manipulated, they are being fleeced, and once the powers that be get what they want they will be discarded. Even after that happens they will never blame the people who did this to them because they will have been brainwashed to blame trans people or immigrants or whatever.</p>",
