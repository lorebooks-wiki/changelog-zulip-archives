Threads is very active but my feed was full of awful people who seem intent on making threads even worse than xitter.

Being faced with the harsh reality of life did a number on my mental well being and I had to shut it off.  Every day I think about the people in Gaza who can't shut it off and can't get away and it makes me so despondent and sad.</p>",
