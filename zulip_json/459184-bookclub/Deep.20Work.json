It helped somewhat, but ultimately I'd ignore it, even though I did it daily... plus there are so many things that come up unexpectedly.</p>\n<p>What I've started doing the last few weeks that is super helpful for me is just leaving my phone on the other side of my office. I can't even hear when it rings, and that's fine. Check it when I get up for water/restroom/etc. That's helped more than anything lol</p>",
