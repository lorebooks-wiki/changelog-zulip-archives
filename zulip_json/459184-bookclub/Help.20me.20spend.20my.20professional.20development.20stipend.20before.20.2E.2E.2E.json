Family commitments keep me from doing either, so I effectively have an infinite book budget.</p>\n<p>I get ebooks for things that I expect to go out of date within a couple years. But I like to get hard copies of “the classics”, foundational references, and books that people still recommend 10 years after they’re published.</p>\n<p>Examples of ones I already have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kerrisk’s Linux Programming Interface</li>\n<li>Rago &amp; Stevens’ Advanced Programming in the Unix Environment</li>\n<li>Knuth’s TAoCP (1-4A)</li>\n<li>Lions’ Commentary on Unix</li>\n<li>Kleppmann’s DDIA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My current interests include operating systems, networking, embedded, and performance. I like deep discussions about implementing real things. I’d like to start using Rust in anger at some point (after doing at least two tutorials), but I also tend to shy away from language specific books unless there’s really good.</p>",
