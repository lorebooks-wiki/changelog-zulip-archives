Chapter 3 is where the primary Rust types are introduced. The real content starts in chapter 4 where the book discusses ownership and moves.</p>\n<p>Chapter 4 really clarified ownership and moves for me by linking Rust types to the stack and the heap. For example, <code>String</code> types are on the heap and number types (e.g., <code>i32</code>) stay on the stack. You later find out that this is powered by <code>Box</code> types and <code>Copy</code> and <code>Clone</code> traits. As functions are called values are moved into the functions unless they are passed by reference (i.e., borrowing) this moving of values is what throws people for a loop at first but the book explains it well with comparisons to Python's referencing counting and C's manual memory management.</p>",

I'm halfway through the chapter but I wanted to write things down before going for a jog.</p>\n<p>Crates are the container for a project's libraries and/or executables. Modules are how you can further organize code within a crate. This is kinda wild to me coming from Go because Go is the opposite- a module is the project source code and packages are the intra-module organization. All good though.</p>\n<p>You can nest modules. Child modules will be able to access both public and private identifiers from parent modules but you still have to use imports (<code>use</code>) to do so. You can choose which identifiers to export using <code>pub</code> and its related <code>pub(crate)</code> and <code>pub(in ./some/path)</code> syntax. I didn't know about that last syntax so that was cool to see.</p>\n<p>There are 3 ways to organize modules.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As their own file <code>foo.rs</code>.</li>\n<li>As a directory with <code>mod.rs</code>:  <code>src/foo/mod.rs</code></li>\n<li>A their own file with child modules in a subdirectory: <code>src/foo/bar.rs</code> and <code>src/foo/bar/example.rs</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>A module can re-export things it imports using <code>pub use</code> and there are keywords <code>super</code> and <code>self</code> to refer to parent modules or the current module respectively.</p>\n<p>Rust has a concept of binary programs and library programs. You can <code>cargo build --bin</code> and <code>carog build --lib</code> respectively. Generally the crate's primary library is <code>src/lib.rs</code> and binaries are <code>src/bin/foo.rs</code> where <code>foo</code> is the resulting executable name.</p>\n<p>Stopped there but ill cover attributes and tests later.</p>",

There's A LOT of content in this chapter that I can't reasonably cover in detail.</p>\n<p>There's a concept of trait objects and generics. Generally speaking we lean towards using generics but there are times where trait objects need the concept of dynamic dispatching which uses the <code>dyn</code> keyword. Basically the <code>dyn</code> keyword is used to say give me any type that implements this trait, but we don't know what those exact types will be at compile time so use dynamic dispatching to find out the right method to call on the given type at runtime.</p>\n<p>I'll definitely be going back to this chapter as I write more Rust code.

What I found the most interesting was the concept that function types and closure types are different. That is, even if you have the same signature for both types one will not be able to be used where the other is accepted and vice versa. I also finally understand why we need <code>Fn</code>, <code>FnOnce</code>, and <code>FnMut</code>. Basically <code>FnOnce</code> is there for closures that drop values to guarantee they will only be called at most once. <code>FnMut</code> can be called multiple times and mutate the data it's passed. This becomes more valuable in multi-threaded programs and such.</p>",
