A quick googling says I have all the setting properly adjusted. It should work but it doesn't. </p>\n<p>Also like why does it wait 15 minutes before it tells me I left something behind. I can be halfway to town by the time I get notified. Just let me know as soon as you lose connection or let me set it the ping frequency FFS.</p>",
