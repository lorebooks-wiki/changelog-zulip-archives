These reflections are about deliberately writing code for 10,000 hours. Most don't apply to beginners. He was clear to mention that these reflections are purely about coding, not career advice or soft skills. If you count the reflections we cover on the show and be the first to comment the amount of reflections on this thread in Zulip, we'll give you a coupon code to use for a 100% free t-shirt from <a href=\"https://merch.changelog.com\">the merch store</a>.
