Python 3.13 is right around the corner, which means the Global Interpeter Lock (GIL) is now experimentally optional! This is a huge deal as Python is finally free-threaded. There's more to discuss, of course, so we get into all the gory details.</p>\n<p><span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.fm/611\">https://changelog.fm/611</a></p>",
