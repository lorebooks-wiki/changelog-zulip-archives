Nora is the founder of <a href=\"http://Jeli.io\">Jeli.io</a>, recently acquired by PagerDuty and she's been shaping the way we think about reliability, incident response, and human-centered engineering for years.</p>\n<p>We get into the real story behind the deal. Not just the headline, but what itâ€™s like selling your company, what it takes to actually integrate a product into a larger platform, how customers responded, what changed for her team, and why her new role at PagerDuty is basically everything she was building Jeli for. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653\">https://changelog.fm/653</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ch</th>\n<th>Start</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Runs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=0\">00:00</a></td>\n<td>This week, LIVE on The Changelog</td>\n<td>01:09</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=70\">01:10</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://auth0.com/ai\">Sponsor: Auth0</a></td>\n<td>01:29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=165\">02:45</a></td>\n<td>Start the LIVE show!</td>\n<td>01:33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=258\">04:18</a></td>\n<td>The <a href=\"http://Jeli.io\">Jeli.io</a> journey and acquisition</td>\n<td>02:17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=395\">06:35</a></td>\n<td>How did you feel about the acquisition process?</td>\n<td>01:38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=493\">08:13</a></td>\n<td>How do you balance your desire for an exit with the needs of the industry you serve?</td>\n<td>01:16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=569\">09:29</a></td>\n<td>Does Jeli as a platform still exist today in PagerDuty?</td>\n<td>02:51</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=740\">12:20</a></td>\n<td>Response from PagerDuty customers when they got access to Jeli?</td>\n<td>05:17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1057\">17:37</a></td>\n<td>How do you juggle managing pricing, product, and growth?</td>\n<td>02:50</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1228\">20:28</a></td>\n<td>How are you thinking about AI at PagerDuty?</td>\n<td>02:39</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1387\">23:07</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.coderabbit.ai\">Sponsor: CodeRabbit</a></td>\n<td>02:43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1550\">25:50</a></td>\n<td>Let's talk about \"novel incidents\"?</td>\n<td>01:21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1631\">27:11</a></td>\n<td>How does PagerDuty think about AI agents in incidents?</td>\n<td>02:11</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/653#t=1762\">29:22</a></td>\n<td>Are you talking with users?

Once an incident occurs the agent downloads all the available information including logs and traces and whatnot and is tasked to create a test which would replicate the incident. It runs in a container with a blank database or some sample staging data and keeps writing tests until the same error comes up. Of course it could also be a kube env with supporting services and such too.</p>",
