There are two typing systems, one built into ruby and one by stripe called sorbet. I prefer the latter because it has type annotations in the code.  I believe both Stripe and Shopify are heavy users of Sorbet so it's in use in massive codebases.</p>\n<p>Most rubyists don't use them because they don't like types but if you do like them they are available for you.</p>\n<p>Finally the sorbet type system is pretty nice. Much nicer that the lame type system in go.</p>",

It will be interesting to see what direction AI driven tools will have on this choice. </p>\n<p>My experience is that there are definitely tradeoffs when using types often at the cost of bloat and messiness of code especially when you are dealing with garbage coming in from the outside world.  In those cases you basically have to build your own type checking at runtime and try and shoehorn that messy data into your neatly typed hierarchy. This kind of stuff is much easier in a language like ruby.</p>",
