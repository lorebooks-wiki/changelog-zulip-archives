As someone who works with protocol buffers daily he's the perfect chef for a crossover interview.</p>\n<p>IMO chef bloggers and influencers have had a huge (but probably immeasurable) impact on the lives of ordinary people. Pre-internet it was way harder to learn techniques and processes to cook and bake better food. The OG Serious Eats was literally life changing for me because for once someone was explaining what was actually happening to the food and why it worked (or didn't). It's the site that got me into cooking which I really enjoy. A lot of techniques like dry brining, sous vide, reverse sear, velveting,  tangzhong, etc. weren't widely known until people started sharing them online. It's similar to the open source phenomenon but for food.</p>",
