If I was working remotely I might even get two or three other jobs and work on all of them at once. </p>\n<p>I am shocked that more people are not doing that now. Just go and get three jobs doing monkey work and have the AI do it. It would be important to get monkey work so that you are not important enough to be invited to meetings. You'd have a hard time justifying why you haven't been able to attend the fourth meeting this month.</p>",

I use AI to write code, I look at code and decide I don't like it and spend a ton of time fixing it up. Not necessarily because it doesn't work but because of aesthetic reasons. I don't want to check in code that looks like that. I want this refactored into a function, I want to handle singletons this way, I want the config to look like this etc.</p>\n<p>I think we may have to let go of our preconceived notions of what good coding style is in the age of AI. If it passes the test then ship it and stop worrying about elegance, or even maintainability. You'll just use AI to fix whatever bug that comes up anyway.</p>\n<p>Having said that it kind of bothers me that he said 90% of his tests are written by the AI. It seems to me that you should write the tests and tell the AI to write code that passes the test but I know that writing tests is often the most cumbersome part of development and it does write comprehensive tests.</p>",
