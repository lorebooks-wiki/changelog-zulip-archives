We discuss programming non-computers, open source resources for embedded, self-driving cars, embedded system like the GoPro, Traeger smokers, and even birthday cards. According to Elecia, embedded is going everywhere. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624\">https://changelog.fm/624</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ch</th>\n<th>Start</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Runs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=0\">00:00</a></td>\n<td>This week on The Changelog</td>\n<td>01:07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=67\">01:07</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.augmentcode.com\">Sponsor: Augment Code</a></td>\n<td>03:30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=276\">04:36</a></td>\n<td>Start the show!!</td>\n<td>02:04</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=400\">06:40</a></td>\n<td>When NPR calls</td>\n<td>01:42</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=502\">08:22</a></td>\n<td>What is embedded?</td>\n<td>03:46</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=728\">12:08</a></td>\n<td>Programming non-computers</td>\n<td>04:32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1000\">16:40</a></td>\n<td>How Elecia got started</td>\n<td>02:32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1152\">19:12</a></td>\n<td>The moment of discovery</td>\n<td>01:36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1248\">20:48</a></td>\n<td>Mentoring for embedded</td>\n<td>02:54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1422\">23:42</a></td>\n<td>Wokwi is cool</td>\n<td>03:34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1635\">27:15</a></td>\n<td>The chasm between sim and real</td>\n<td>04:33</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=1908\">31:48</a></td>\n<td>The constraints of embedded</td>\n<td>04:13</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=2161\">36:01</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://fly.io/\">Sponsor: Fly.io</a></td>\n<td>02:29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=2310\">38:30</a></td>\n<td>How big is the embedded world?</td>\n<td>03:57</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=2547\">42:27</a></td>\n<td>Open source + embedded</td>\n<td>01:30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=2637\">43:57</a></td>\n<td>Elecia loves Kalman filters!</td>\n<td>03:45</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=2862\">47:42</a></td>\n<td>Elecia's thoughts on self-driving cars</td>\n<td>09:23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=3425\">57:05</a></td>\n<td>Self-driving on a closed-system</td>\n<td>02:02</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=3547\">59:07</a></td>\n<td>GoPro is embedded</td>\n<td>04:00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=3787\">1:03:07</a></td>\n<td>Traeger smokers are embedded</td>\n<td>06:07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=4154\">1:09:14</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://joindeleteme.com\">Sponsor: DeleteMe</a></td>\n<td>01:55</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=4269\">1:11:09</a></td>\n<td>What do you want to build next?</td>\n<td>03:21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=4470\">1:14:30</a></td>\n<td>CrunchLabs!</td>\n<td>03:07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=4657\">1:17:37</a></td>\n<td>What else is cool?</td>\n<td>01:52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=4770\">1:19:30</a></td>\n<td>Embedded is going everywhere</td>\n<td>05:20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=5089\">1:24:49</a></td>\n<td>IoT, let us 'opt out'</td>\n<td>03:37</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>27</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=5306\">1:28:26</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"http://Embedded.fm\">Embedded.fm</a> and other places</td>\n<td>04:08</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>28</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=5554\">1:32:34</a></td>\n<td>Wrapping up</td>\n<td>00:24</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>29</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=5578\">1:32:58</a></td>\n<td>Closing thoughts and stuff</td>\n<td>02:56</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/624#t=5754\">1:35:54</a></td>\n<td>BONUS teaser :)</td>\n<td>01:45</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

I wrote some of it in assembly, some of it in C.  I used the joystick port to receive signals from the electrodes.  I also turned the signals into sound which could be recorded on tape for the doctors to listen to. </p>\n<p>It was super interesting and apparently turned out very insightful for the doctors. Turing motions into sounds and characters was kind of an innovation back then.</p>",
