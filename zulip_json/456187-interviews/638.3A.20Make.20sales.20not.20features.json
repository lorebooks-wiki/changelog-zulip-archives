During our travels we ended up in Oamaru where we went to a local distiller where they had a whisky tasting  menu.  I ended up buying a couple of bottles of limited edition whiskies and they have sat in my cupboard for years now. I keep saying they are for a special occasion but so far I guess no occasion has been special enough. Maybe I should crack them open just because but I don't think that much or that often so maybe I should just gift them to somebody who will drink the whole bottle.</p>\n<p>If you ever visit New Zealand there are a couple of distillers in the south island. We went to two of them.</p>\n<p>This is the one I bought the bottles from <a href=\"https://www.thenzwhisky.com/cellar-door/\">https://www.thenzwhisky.com/cellar-door/</a></p>",
