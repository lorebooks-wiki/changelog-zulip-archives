There would be building and floor supervisors who would be responsible for making sure people don't abuse the system by using their quarters for storage or being destructive and whatnot.</p>\n<p>This would provide a downward pressure on housing, food, and energy costs as the private sector has to deal with the release valve of government provided basic services.   At the same time although these conditions are sufficient to keep somebody alive they are not pleasant and would continue to encourage people to seek employment for better living conditions.</p>\n<p>Of course if they let me design society the conditions would improve as productivity from automation goes up and who knows maybe some day everybody will get a three bedroom house with a yard.</p>",
