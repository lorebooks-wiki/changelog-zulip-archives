At the same time although these conditions are sufficient to keep somebody alive they are not pleasant and would continue to encourage people to seek employment for better living conditions.</p>\n<p>Of course if they let me design society the conditions would improve as productivity from automation goes up and who knows maybe some day everybody will get a three bedroom house with a yard.</p>",
