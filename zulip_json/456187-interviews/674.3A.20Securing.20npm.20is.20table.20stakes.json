        "content": "<p>As the creator and long-time maintainer of ESLint, Nicholas Zakas is well-positioned to criticize GitHub's recent response to npm's insecurity. He found the response insufficient, and has other ideas on how GitHub could secure npm better. On this episode, Nicholas details these ideas, paints a bleak picture of npm alternatives like JSR, and shares our frustration that such a critical piece of internet infrastructure feels neglected. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674\">https://changelog.fm/674</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ch</th>\n<th>Start</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Runs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=0\">00:00</a></td>\n<td>Welcome to The Changelog</td>\n<td>01:01</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=61\">01:01</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tigerdata.com\">Sponsor: Tiger Data</a></td>\n<td>02:34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=214\">03:34</a></td>\n<td>Start the show!</td>\n<td>01:21</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=295\">04:55</a></td>\n<td>Recent npm history</td>\n<td>05:12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=607\">10:07</a></td>\n<td>GitHub's response</td>\n<td>03:10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=797\">13:17</a></td>\n<td>Trusted publishing</td>\n<td>03:12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=988\">16:28</a></td>\n<td>What makes it trusted</td>\n<td>03:49</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=1217\">20:17</a></td>\n<td>What they're not doing</td>\n<td>02:36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=1373\">22:53</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://namespace.so\">Sponsor: Namespace</a></td>\n<td>01:38</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=1471\">24:31</a></td>\n<td>Misaligned incentives</td>\n<td>03:18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=1668\">27:48</a></td>\n<td>One big attack away</td>\n<td>03:27</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=1875\">31:15</a></td>\n<td>How staffed is npm?</td>\n<td>02:17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=2012\">33:32</a></td>\n<td>Is using npm still prudent?</td>\n<td>04:22</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=2274\">37:54</a></td>\n<td>Pre/post install hooks</td>\n<td>09:29</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=2842\">47:22</a></td>\n<td>Verified publishers</td>\n<td>02:56</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=3019\">50:19</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.squarespace.com/changelog\">Sponsor: Squarespace</a></td>\n<td>01:23</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=3102\">51:42</a></td>\n<td>JSR and vlt</td>\n<td>05:36</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=3438\">57:18</a></td>\n<td>An Anthropic registry</td>\n<td>06:06</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=3804\">1:03:24</a></td>\n<td>How other ecosystems do it</td>\n<td>05:12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4116\">1:08:36</a></td>\n<td>The cool factor</td>\n<td>01:32</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4207\">1:10:07</a></td>\n<td>The profit incentive</td>\n<td>02:54</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>22</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4382\">1:13:02</a></td>\n<td>Nicholas' work</td>\n<td>02:43</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>23</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4544\">1:15:44</a></td>\n<td>Connecting with Nicholas</td>\n<td>01:07</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>24</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4611\">1:16:51</a></td>\n<td>AI: not just hype</td>\n<td>02:35</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>25</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4766\">1:19:26</a></td>\n<td>Wrapping up</td>\n<td>00:25</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>26</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/674#t=4792\">1:19:52</a></td>\n<td>Closing thoughts</td>\n<td>01:18</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

The premise is simple.  Each package consists of two part, a manifest and a blob (zip file). </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The manifest is plain text (xml) and is hosted on any https URL. </li>\n<li>The URL could be the private server of the author or a centralized repository or a github/gitlab repo</li>\n<li>The manifest has mandatory fields such as author, dependencies, the binary format, whether the blob is signed etc.</li>\n<li>One mandatory field is the checksum of the blob</li>\n<li>the blob contains the manifest minus (minus the checksum field which is added when the package is published)</li>\n<li>The manifest lists the required permissions to install (like the app store)</li>\n<li>the manifest contains the pre and post install scripts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The blob is stored on a distributed file system using the checksum as the file name.</p>\n<p>Anybody can examine the manifest to make sure everything is up to snuff.</p>\n<p>The package manager downloads the manifest, resolves dependencies, and downloads the binary. It opens up the binary and compares the manifest in the blob with the published one to make sure everything matches.<br>\nThe package manager verifies any signatures etc.<br>\nThe package manager is an interpreter for a very small and limited language which can run pre and post install scripts in the manifest (CDATA sections). The code is run sandboxed and asks the user for permissions if the script attempts to reach out to the internet, access the file system outside of the sandbox etc. </p>\n<p>Optionally the package manager can be node in the distributed file system which would make it able to cache the packages for repeat installs.</p>\n<p>In an ideal world there would be a crypto currency where the user can earn money for acting as a node and the package maintainer can charge for the packages.   Some careful thought can result in a thriving economy of open source packages.</p>\n<p>The whole thing would be decentralized so no central authority no corporate control or anything.</p>",
