I went back and listened to your interview with Sandi Metz (a hero of mine) from years ago - she has a very different take.</p>\n<p>Carson's take reminded me of one of my favourite books, _A Pattern Language_, which is about architecture. Pattern 116 is about the arrangement of roofs. If I may:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let us observe, first, that many beautiful buildings have the form of a cascade: a tumbling arrangement of wings and lower wings and smaller rooms and sheds, often with a single highest center. Hagia Sophia, the Norwegian stave churches, and Palladio's villas are imposing and magnificent examples. Simple houses, small informal building complexes, and even clusters of mud huts are more modest ones.</p>\n<p>What is it that makes the cascading chara so sound and so appropriate? First of all, <strong>there is a social meaning in this form</strong>. The largest gathering places with the highest ceilings are in the middle because they are the social centers of activities; smaller groups of people, individual rooms, and alcoves fall naturally around the edges.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a social meaning in big classes, and large files, too!</p>",
