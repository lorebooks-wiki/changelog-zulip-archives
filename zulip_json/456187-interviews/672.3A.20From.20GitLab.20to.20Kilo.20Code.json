Sounds like he's doing a lot of amazing work with the companies that he is building and the cancer treatment initiatives he's pushing forward.  I did have one nitpick about the conversation, Sid mentioned that AGI is \"already here\" but if he's referring to the 2023 paper, that opinion is not generally accepted by the experts in the fields. Most are estimating AGI to arrive somewhere around 2040. I know a lot of the VC backed companies would like folks to think otherwise or want to change the definition of what AGI is but it's not the case.</p>",
