To celebrate, we sat down with Travis Oliphant –creator of NumPy, SciPy, and more– to get his perspective on how Python took over the software world.</p>\n<p>Stick around for the twist ending! We set aside Python and dissect Travis' big idea to make open source projects financially sustainable through direct investment. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\"

Julia is rapidly taking over python's place in scientific computing especially amongst the graduate students.</p>\n<p>As for his idea of funding OS software I remain highly pessimistic. His vision requires an incredible amount of coordination and good will amongst tens of thousands of people most of whom are primarily driven by the profit motive. </p>\n<p>I think I have an idea of how we could fund OSS and it's much simpler. Make a packaging system that requires payment (something like npm, rubygems etc). People can host their projects on the system and if you want to pull something you get charged every time you pull it. You get charged for every dep you pull down so if my code costs X and I have a depdency that costs Y you get charged X+Y.  The package manager calculates the total cost so you can look at it before you decide to use it. All payments are automatic via blockchain premined currency.</p>\n<p>Easy, simple, automatic.</p>",

You shouldn't have to worry about typing things until you need to. This is why I enjoyed playing with Crystal so much. It has very strong type inference and also a really good type system.</p>\n<p>As a side note. I think at a minimum every language should have every type in postgres including nullable types. Eventually I will be pushing things into and out of postgres so I want a strong match.
