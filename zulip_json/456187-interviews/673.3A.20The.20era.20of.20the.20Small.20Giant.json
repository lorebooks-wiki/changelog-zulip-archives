Damien officially returns to The Changelog to discuss the seismic shift happening in software development. From the first sponsor of the podcast to frontline builder in the AI agent era, Damien shares his insights on why SaaS is dying, why code review is a bottleneck (and non-existent for some), and how small teams can now build giant things. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673\">https://changelog.fm/673</a></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Ch</th>\n<th>Start</th>\n<th>Title</th>\n<th>Runs</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>01</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=0\">00:00</a></td>\n<td>This week on The Changelog</td>\n<td>01:26</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>02</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=86\">01:26</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://depot.dev\">Sponsor: Depot</a></td>\n<td>02:18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>03</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=224\">03:44</a></td>\n<td>Start the show!</td>\n<td>01:47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>04</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=331\">05:31</a></td>\n<td>AI Engineer (AIE) Code Summit 2025</td>\n<td>03:58</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>05</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=569\">09:29</a></td>\n<td>What is/was Pusher?</td>\n<td>03:34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>06</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=783\">13:03</a></td>\n<td>How are today's days different?</td>\n<td>02:17</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>07</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=920\">15:20</a></td>\n<td>SaaS is dead!?</td>\n<td>13:52</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>08</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=1752\">29:12</a></td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.tigerdata.com\">Sponsor: Tiger Data</a></td>\n<td>02:30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>09</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://changelog.fm/673#t=1901\">31:41</a></td>\n<td>No code review?

Just because an app builds and “works” doesn’t mean there aren’t issues, especially when building with unsafe languages as is common on web. Memory leaks, logic errors, security vulnerabilities don’t go away just because we are using new tools. Maintainability is still a valid concern and software engineering best practices don’t go out the window just because we have turned the reins over.  People YOLOing software are in for a rude awakening.</p>\n<p>Independent agents to do code review are a good safeguard but should not be the only safeguard.</p>",

Who cares, it's cheap and fast and reasonably good.</p>\n<p>Hell in the near future AI will be the only ones using your app in the first place.</p>\n<p>Turtles all the way down.</p>",
