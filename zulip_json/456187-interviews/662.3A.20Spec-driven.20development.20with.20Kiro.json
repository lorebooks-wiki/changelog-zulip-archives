I agree that the new tools will drive down cost (some places) for things, but I didn't think about how this tools may become the bare minimum. Kind of like everyone just has to have a data plan to participate in the world. There could be a world where developers need a Claude subscription to be competitive.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how it'll play out, indie movies do exist alongside summer blockbusters, but even in that case, one is more prevalent and funded</p>",

Of course you'd need to give some extended prompt about what the app is trying to do, not to use any mocks or stubs etc.  </p>\n<p>instead of writing specs why not write a test suite and have the agent toil until all tests pass.</p>\n<p>This would be a good test of an agent I bet.</p>",
