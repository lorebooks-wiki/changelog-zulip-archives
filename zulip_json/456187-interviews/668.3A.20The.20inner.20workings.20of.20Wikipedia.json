Bill has been heavily involved with this \"8th wonder of the modern world\" for two decades and even built a career on it, founding Buetler Ink –a digital agency known for its pioneering work in Wikipedia public relations.</p>\n<p>We discuss: the official (and not so official) rules, the editor cabal (which isn't one), the business model (which really isn't one), how an edit sticks (or not), how AI chatbots threaten the future of the site (or don't), and a whole lot more. <span aria-label=\"link\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f517\" role=\"img\" title=\"link\">:link:</span> <a
