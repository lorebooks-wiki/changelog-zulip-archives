Otherwise it feels a bit strange to me to just Kool-Aid-Man into y'all's conversations out of nowhere.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm Alex Guyot, lead software engineers over at MacStories for anyone who's into Apple-y stuff, and also an engineer at a small startup in the Twin Cities area in Minnesota. Been a Changelog listener for a couple years now and I'm excited to finally jump on the ++ train and to hang out with you all on Zulip!</p>\n<p>Hopefully others drop more intros in here!</p>",
