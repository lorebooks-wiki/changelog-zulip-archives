I have no pain so far, but I want it to keep it that way... <br>\nThe ZSA gear looks really tempting, but it is really expensive to get in Germany... customs will add around 80€ of costs... so, depending on the current currency conversion rates, I am looking at about 408€ in total... without ever having a mechanical keyboard before, and I'm not sure how well I would handle the transition. There is rarely any second-hand market either...<br>\nDoes anyone have good alternatives for German citizens? I am willing to spend a bit more, but I think somewhere around 300€ would be my limit I would be comfortable to spend.</p>",

Are there any recommended stepping stones for someone who has never tried a split keyboard?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I tried the Logitech K860 for a few days a couple years ago and it is really good. Unfortunately I couldn't get one with a Portuguese layout, so now I didn't buy one for my girlfriend. The Microsoft Sculpt is also quite nice, though I was only able to get it as a kit with a mouse that isn't bad but is light-years away from the Logitech vertical mouse. Also, it forces you to use both the mouse and the keyboard, the keyboard alone doesn't work. And it's not Bluetooth, you have to use the proprietary MS dongle that comes with it, meaning that if you lose it, you toss everything out the window. Both units use replaceable batteries, which is a very positive aspect.</p>",

I use a Glove80 and absolutely love it, it's super comfortable, customisable, can be used wired or wirelessly via bluetooth, and it's just great. The Dygma is also very nice but doesn't have a concave key well, which was the decisimg factor for me, making it less ergonomic. On the flip side, because it's flat, it's a little easier to carry. The Dygma also doesn't have both wired and wireless in the same unit, if I recall correctly. You have to pick one or the other.</p>",
