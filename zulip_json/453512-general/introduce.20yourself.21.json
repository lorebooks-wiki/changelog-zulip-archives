Now I am still listening, while I am working on quantum computing at Xanadu Quantum Technologies! I love to listen while I code, and the pods give me tons of ideas for tools to leverage and topics to discuss with the team. I was previously a guest on Practical AI talking about quantum computers. I also recently updated my GitHub bio:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\"><pre><span></span><code>Full Stack Quantum Engineer.
