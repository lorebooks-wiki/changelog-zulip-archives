        "content": "<p><strong>Terraform</strong><br>\nI mostly found imports to be pretty good. Most resources define an import. A key challenge was branches with a central state server. If I import a resource on a branch, then open a PR, then someone else runs <code>tf apply</code> from <code>main</code>, it'll delete the imported resource, which might take production down.</p>\n<p><strong>CDK</strong><br>\nGood library coverage for most AWS resources. Poor coverage for anything else.<br>\nExample: if you want to define Airflow in IaC, you want not just things like the Airflow version, but also some key configuration like the S3 bucket for DAGs and the Database Connection. Those can be defined via a REST API, but there are no CDK resources for them. The only solution is to write a Lambda function that runs after the resource is created and makes the changes.</p>\n<p>CDK is roughly a DSL for CloudFormation. CloudFormation only ensures that what you wrote gets run, but not that the end result matches the plan. CloudFormation has <em>drift detection</em>, but it's not part of the CDK workflow.</p>\n<p>CDK doesn't have great ways to share information across stacks. Imagine you have two services, <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, where <code>foo</code> depends on <code>bar</code>. Each service can have its own stack with its own VPC, database, Docker container, DNS, etc. They can live in sibling directories. But there isn't a good way to get the DNS address out of the <code>bar</code> stack and inject it into the <code>foo</code> stack. The standard answer is to define it in a constant and import the package as a JS import from the workspace. But that doesn't work well for <em>outputs</em>. (Constructs can have outputs, but they only get resolved within a single stack as far as I can tell.)</p>\n<p>Sadly, I don't know why CDK was chosen for this stack. That choice predates a major pivot in business model and none of those engineers are still around.</p>",

Same if they use SST (which uses Pulumi under the hood).<br>\nAWS CDK has extensive support for some higher level components on top of the underlying AWS resources, Pulumi has far fewer such components.<br>\nThere is an adapter/library to use AWS CDK components in Pulumi, which currently only supports TypeScript. </p>\n<p>Both Terraform and Pulumi have the advantage that they are not restricted to AWS resources. Pulumi's integration/co-existence with Terraform is better than AWS CDK &amp; Terraform, if you would consider Terraform for some type of infrastructure.</p>\n<p>System Initiative is a very different beast, but an interesting one. It is a bit more like infrastructure-as-diagrams-with-code-customisations, and rather have a concept of \"digital twins\" for the infrastructure instead of separate state representations stored somewhere - a more interactive approach. It has been a while since I looked at it, and back then it did not have a good story for importing existing reasources, but was on the todo-list.

I've worked with CF, CDK, Terraform/OpenTofu and Pulumi, and in a greenfield project with a team that doesn't have a strong background in a particular IaC framework yet, I'd pick Pulumi. (Although I might reach for CDK when it's a small, AWS-only project.) I find modularizing code and implementing things like loops and conditional properties in a higher-level language more convenient than expressing this in HCL.</p>\n<p>Even though it looks like CDK and Pulumi are closely related, Pulumi is a lot closer to Terraform. CDK produces CF templates, which are then sent to the fairly opaque CF service run by AWS. Pulumi, like Terraform, has its own engine that's running locally. This leads to faster feedback/failures and makes debugging easier. It also means you can bring your own resource providers, you can even create them dynamically in some languages, and you can create CLI tools for infrastructure self-service.</p>",
