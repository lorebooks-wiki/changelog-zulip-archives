        "content": "<p>Man I gave myself a headache playing with gemini cli some more. For the last couple of days I have been asking it to write an app in different languages. This time not a web app. I created a simple task. Take a list of directories, analyze the files in those directories, create a catalog in an sqlite file which lists every file and directory, some metadata about the files, and for the directories the number of files in the hierarchy and the total size of the directory (including subdirs).   I specifically asked it to take advantage of concurrency features of the language to make it as performant as possible. The languages I asked it to code in were ruby, typescript using bun, go, and rust.</p>\n<p>It wrote the ruby code without issues but it wasn't multi threading properly so I asked it to fix it and it did. Then I asked it to also use fibers so I can test the difference and it did.  It used unusual strategies to process the directories and to calculate sums. It used SQL queries to calculate sums which was interesting to me.</p>\n<p>It wrote the bun code but had no concurrency. I asked it to use workers but it couldn't manage that properly. </p>\n<p>It completely fucked up the go code. I tried to work with it going back and forth but tired of it so I abandoned it.</p>\n<p>It wrote the rust code and it ran. I don't know rust so when I opened up in vs code I asked the gemini vs code plugin to explain it to me and it said \"you should change this code to like this\" and so I did. I ran the code a few times running into errors and each time it fixed it's error so in the end I had a working app.</p>\n<p>Here is the headache part. The ruby code runs about as fast as the rust code. Like WTF? They both give different results for the number of files and the total size of all the files. What's worse is that both of these numbers disagree with <code>du -s .</code> and <code>find . -type f | wc -l</code> which in turn disagrees with finder when I click on get info.</p>\n<p>I guess a man with four watches never knows what time it is.</p>",

People don't use frameworks so everybody hand rolls their own implementation of everything all of which are slightly different than each other. When the LLM takes a snippet of this and a snippet of that they don't work together. </p>\n<p>What doesn't help is that go is too simple as a core language so you can write things in myriad of ways, there is not a pythonic \"there is only way to do things\", all you have is a pile of tiny legos and you have to assemble them into an airplane or an construction site. To strain the analogy other languages give you propellers, wheels,  circular bricks etc to build the same thing so it's a lot more obvious with them.</p>\n<p>Finally go is ideologically and structurally opposed to building abstractions. There is a reason you don't have classes, or function/method overriding,  enums, decorations, macros etc.  they want everything to be explicit and verbose as possible. This means every codebase in go contains a lot of setup and ceremony to accomplish simple things and when chunking these projects may be split up in weird places where you include the implementation in one chunk but the setup and ceremony is on another chunk and they need to be together in order to work properly.</p>\n<p>Those are my guesses as to why it failed so hard.
