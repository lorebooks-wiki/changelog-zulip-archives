(The little metaprogramming I still did could be handled by decorators and context managers, which also happened to cleanly divide into \"compile time\" vs. \"run time\" metaprogramming.)</p>\n<p>Also, the F100 I worked for had their own <code>python</code> build that compiled in all of their proprietary libraries, which gave me access to a whole new world that had previously been hidden behind nasty XML RPC services that were meant to be a fallback for anyone who wasn't using the blessed C++ or Python tools.
