One possible outcome from this is a competing ruby based full stack framework and I for one would welcome that. Rails is full of magic and is a memory hog and isn't that JIT friendly and doesn't work well with jruby. It would be interesting to create a new framework that's no or very low magic and maybe even embraces RBS or Sorbet to provide type safety.</p>",
