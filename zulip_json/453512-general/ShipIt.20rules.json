Specifically, I think the voice that Autumn brings to the table teaches me so many things, and I appreciate the opportunity to just listen. Please keep it going.</p>\n<p>Justin rules, too; just want to highlight how much Autumn brings to the table for me.</p>",

        "content": "<p>The show is great overall. The hosts and guests cover interesting content and keep the human aspect in the conversation which I like. Sometimes they get off topic a bit too much and it leaves me wanting more of the topic but that can happen anywhere so it's not so much a problem as it is just a note. I wouldn't change the hosts at all but sometimes the audio levels aren't equal and it's jarring since some audio (e.g., Autumn's laughter) comes in quite higher than everyone else's audio. I love the laugh though it makes listening fun!</p>",
