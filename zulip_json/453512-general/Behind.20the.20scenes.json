I’m always wondering how you guys can keep such a grueling pace and pump out so much content for so long. How do you stay on top of your interview pipeline, edit episodes, research content for news, work with advertisers, spend time coding, try new tech, homelab, BBQ, spend time with family (6 kids, Jerod!), rewatch Silicon Valley, etc. and stay sane? A glimpse into your process would be awesome.</p>",
