General should be more for announcements / introduce yourself style discussions? </p>\n<p>If there aren't any podcast specific discussions going on in General, our attention wont be skewed and we'll need to simply head to the discussions we're interested in to begin with. This probably makes more sense anyway as everyone has their favorite series they listen to, and will likely just subscribe to those podcast-specific channels.</p>\n<p>A potential mix of the options is to have a Master Feed channel, which has a topic for every podcast episode as they get released. But this would probably become unwieldy. <br>\nIt would however unify the direction of attention to all discussions. </p>\n<p>But again, I think separating into podcast-specific channels is more in line with the way we're already used to navigating the content from Changelog (i.e, which podcasts we're subscribed to in our podcast apps).</p>\n<p>Exciting!
