Is it tv? Is it a movie? Do I go against the channel's grain or do I start a new one called #other-videos-that-arent-tv-or-movies?</p>\n<p>I suggest (open to discussion, of course) that we try to organize around specific-yet-generic verbs for channels and see how that works. So we might create:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>#reading (post about things you're reading or think others might enjoy)</li>\n<li>#writing (post about the art/craft of... writing)</li>\n<li>#watching (we could rename <a class=\"stream\" data-stream-id=\"460285\" href=\"/#narrow/stream/460285-tv-movies\">#tv-movies</a> to this)</li>\n<li>#listening (maybe for non-changelog-specific podcasts, music, I dunno this one might be bad)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Has anybody ever tried organizing discussions this way? Might it work well?</p>",

One thing I'd say is a #writing channel would probably be pretty quiet most of the time, and if you've written a blog post, it might be confusing whether to put that in #reading or #writing... maybe the producer and consumer side of these get collapsed into just one, and separated by topics?</p>",
