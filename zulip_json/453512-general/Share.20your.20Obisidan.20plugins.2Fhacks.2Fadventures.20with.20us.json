Have any good Obsidian plugins/hacks/adventures to share with us?</p>",

The files are a custom format that is JSON under the hood which isn't ideal, but yet to find a better alternative.</p>\n<p>Dataview - really useful, I mainly use it for it's ability to write js functions in files.</p>\n<p>Folder notes - I like to use this so that I can click on folders and have a contents page showing the files inside folder. Makes navigation easier for me. </p>\n<p>Slash commander - use too add new slash commands for commands I run regularly </p>\n<p>Templater - I use this a lot for regular notes I make, so I can set the same basic layout for my weekly organiser and also set the date as the title. </p>\n<p>Sync - finally bit the bullet and paid for the official sync service. Really glad I did, I was using a plugin called remotely save for a long time with minio. But had issues with files not syncing and losing changes. This feels a lot more polished.</p>",

One thing I always miss when using Obsidian is the built-in terminal like in VS Code.</p>\n<p>I also use the Sync plugin like Alex and it's worth the $. It just works.</p>\n<p>Before using Obsidian, I just had a pile of markdown files I stored in git. I wrote a Python script to aggregate all my TODOs into a single top-level TODO.md file. When I switched to Obsidian, I didn't want to run the script out-of-band so I made my own extension. I creatively named it <a href=\"https://github.com/joeriddles/extended-task-lists\">Extended Task Lists</a>.</p>\n<p>It automatically aggregates your TODOs and also adds two new types of TODO: <code>- [~]</code> for things you won't do and <code>- [.]</code> for things in progress. Something I kinda picked up from Adam Savage's book Every Tools a Hammer is partially filling in TODOs (with pen + paper).</p>",

Two of my favorites were Ecco Pro which got sold and immediately shelved and info select which was a DOS program at the time and still exists (much to my surprise). I even tried org mode for a day or two.</p>\n<p>Today I have some snippets of notes on apple notes and some on google keep. Just tiny little snippets of information.</p>",
