I am curious about your reaction when an open source project puts religious or political statements on their home pages or repositories.</p>\n<p>We live in contentious times and there are wars happening all over the place.  If a project says \"free Palestine\" or \"We stand with Israel\"  will that sway your decision to use the product one way or the other. Same goes for supporting Russia or Ukraine or Pakistan or India or China or Trump. </p>\n<p>As for me yes it does effect my decision. I don't want to support a project whose political and moral stances are opposed to mine. </p>\n<p>What about you guys?</p>",

Others just want Palestinians to have the same rights as Jews. Pro-Israelis are diverse in a very similar way. </p>\n<p>Not all debates are so ambiguous, but I see similarities in the Capitalism/Communism/Socialism as well as the pro-life/pro-choice debates. Each side pretends that everyone on the opposite side is the most extreme caricature of that argument. The optimal solution is probably somewhere in the middle.</p>\n<p>All this is to say: Sometimes I think people choose to drop out of a political debate not because they don't care, but because they don't see any reasonable side to join.</p>",
