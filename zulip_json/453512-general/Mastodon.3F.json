Beyond that, it really doesn’t matter. You can follow anyone on any other instance that doesn’t block your instance and isn’t blocked by yours. If you find your instance unpalatable for any reason, migrating to another is relatively painless. I started my own instance when the Twitter drama started, but maintaining it became obnoxious so I migrated to <a href=\"http://hachyderm.io\">hachyderm.io</a> because I appreciated its governance structure and interesting domain name. The most important thing is to just get an account <em>somewhere</em> and start exploring so you can figure out how it fits into your uses.</p>",

I’ve never found Twitter useful for discovery. It’s always felt like a constantly churning hype train, like Hacker News but with less interesting discussion. I only used it to see what the people I find interesting are up to (ie, micro-blogging, as it was originally meant for), and Mastodon serves that purpose for me much better than Twitter ever did. If I want news I’ll read a news site or reddit. If I want memes I’ve got reddit and Tumblr. For chatting with friends I’ve got Discord. Twitter in its modern form doesn’t work for me, and hasn’t really since long before Elon burned it down.</p>",
