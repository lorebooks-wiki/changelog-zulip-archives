At least a decade at this point.</p>\n<p>What would be really interesting to me is if there were some episodes that revisited an old topic with the original guest. And I don't mean topics from 2 or 3 years ago, I mean 10 or more. For example you could revisited \"The Rise of io.js #139\",  \"Hoodie, noBackend, Offline-First #111\", or \"<a href=\"http://Exercism.io\">Exercism.io</a> and Crowd-Sourced Code Reviews #108\".</p>\n<p>This would be super interesting as some stories would be successes, and others failures. Hearing about what those people learned over the last decade, and how the project progressed would provide an awesome insight.</p>",
