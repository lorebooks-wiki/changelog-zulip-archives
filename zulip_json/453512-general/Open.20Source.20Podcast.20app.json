This looks pretty cool but here is some input if you want it.</p>\n<p>I listen to podcasts mostly in my car and I live in NZ so mobile bandwidth is really expensive to me.  My two most important features in a podcast app are downloading the podcasts only on wifi,  and an intuitive easy to use GUI when I am driving, and apple car play integration.</p>\n<p>I don't think PWAs can download podcasts only on wifi but if you ever decide to push this and make it an app it's something to consider.</p>",
