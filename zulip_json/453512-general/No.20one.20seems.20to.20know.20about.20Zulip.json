AirBnB was just a very early adopter of it. I agree with their reasons for moving away from it though.  React Native never really delivered on the promise of a good mobile experience via a single code base.  Swift and Kotlin do a far better job. It's easy to find React developers than can muddle through writing react native apps but you don't get an end product that has the same level of polish as a true native app. It's great for proving out an MVP and getting to market quickly but if you have to staff  to do so it's better long term to have separate Swift and Kotlin apps.</p>",

Then it could be:</p>\n<p><code>/#/applenerds/topic/501702223</code></p>\n<p>And linking to a message could be:</p>\n<p><code>/#/applenerds/topic/501702223/message/8675309</code></p>\n<p>You could even establish a default pattern where it's always: <code>/:channel/:topic/:message</code>. Then deep-linking to a specific Zulip message would be as clean as:</p>\n<p><code>/#/applenerds/501702223/8675309</code></p>\n<p>I'm sure there's all kinds of technical reasons why making these kind of changes throughout the app would be difficult, and I'm not even suggesting that it's worth your while. I just know pretty URLs when I see them (GitHub is a great example of this) and Zulip lacks in that (admittedly narrow) category.</p>\n<h2>On emoji</h2>\n<p>The emoji picker on desktop is fine, but the mobile one is super slow to use. What's lacking from both is some kind of \"recently used\" or \"frequently used\" that is customized to you. Another way of tackling that same need is by letting people <em>sticky</em> their favorite/frequent emoji to the top/front.</p>\n<p>An example: I'm a <span aria-label=\"green heart\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f49a\" role=\"img\" title=\"green heart\">:green_heart:</span> guy. I pretty much never use the red one (ok one person gets the red one, but she's not here <span aria-label=\"wink\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f609\" role=\"img\" title=\"wink\">:wink:</span>). The red one may be popular, but I have no use for it in this context, so I have to go fetch the green one each time.</p>\n<p>Each of us probably have a set of emoji that we use often enough that we'd like some more advanced features to improve the experience.</p>",

After that, you can sign up for a paid plan to keep access. You’ve got a year until this app starts deleting older pictures.</li>\n<li><strong>Can I download my pictures?</strong> You can download the ones you’ve shared with all your friends! A paid plan is required to download the rest.</li>\n<li><strong>I wrote an app to crop my ex out of my pictures. Can I use it?</strong> You can use any app in our app store.</li>\n<li><strong>Can I use my app if it's not in your app store?</strong> To keep you safe, you can use your app on up to 15 photos per minute if it’s not in the app store.</li>\n<li><strong>All right, how do I get my app into your app store?</strong> Submit it for review, and we’ll approve if your app is the right fit for the SnatchCam Marketplace. Make sure at least 9 of your friends already have it installed.</li>\n<li><strong>I'm switching to another camera app. I’m on a paid plan — you said I can download my pictures?</strong> You need a more expensive paid plan.</li>\n<li><strong>OK, I’m on the expensive plan now, let me download my photos!</strong> Your application to download your photos has been denied.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>",
