It's still perfectly functional, but has effectively been unmaintained for quite a while. On macOS I've been using Tabby, with the cross-platform ideal being my focus, but ufhsgsyshgs Electron for terminal is a bad time, so haven't adopted for personal use. Ghostty gives me something better on macOS for now at least, though Tilix and Tabby's support for quake-specific styling (transparency etc) is also handy. Using a bunch less RAM is very compelling though :D</p>",
