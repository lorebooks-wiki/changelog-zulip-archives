Somewhere along the conversation Dr. Batalha hesitated and then used the word \"spectrum\" saying she wasn't sure if she should be using that word, she immediately followed up by saying she won't use the word rainbow.  The implication was that these words could trigger the ire of the current administration. </p>\n<p>We have seen universities delete any language that could possibly be associated with any kind of \"identity politics\" from their web sites and communications and apparently the word is going out to the academia to refrain from saying certain words.</p>\n<p>This is the very definition of \"politically correct speech\"</p>",
