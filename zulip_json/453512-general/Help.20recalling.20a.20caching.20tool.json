I swear I remember hearing about a tool mentioned on an episode, but all of my efforts to find it via transcripts have come up short and I was hoping others here might remember.  I think it may have been Nick or Jerod mentioning it on a episode covering different tools, and I think it may have been in a Neovim setup around language server configuration, but IIRC the idea is that you'd use it to run commands or hit upstream API and it would cache the output/reponse for you, and I <em>think</em> maybe there was even mention of it serving stale results?  Does that ring a bell with anyone?</p>",
