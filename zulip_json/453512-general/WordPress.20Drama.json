Our studio built many sites on the open-source project and since we still manage a few sites that use it (and are hosted on various generic hosting services or on-prem), I come into contact with it from time to time. This situation makes me immensely sad, since only grief and destruction can come out of such conflict after a certain point and that point was passed long time ago in this case.</p>\n<p>That DHH post <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"752922\">@Nabeel S</span> linked is closest to how I feel about this. The open-source project is in a way a gift and if he felt it couldn't be sustained this way, there were ways to communicate that and to start making gradual changes toward sustainability. There was also definitely a way to phrase the message that WPE are harmful parasites and should be ostracised that wouldn't prompt the C&amp;D letter. Or it would and people would sympathise with Matt, the victim of being silenced by a big bad <del>wolf</del> private equity fund and all that. Sure, some would raise their eyebrows, his company being a direct competitor of WPE (and also highly profitable), but the truth of the immense contribution disparity was on his side. These actions, however, from continuous W.org-branded attacks, through the hostage crisis with plugin directory access and WPE dev account suspensions, to petty moves like this last checkbox (again on <a href=\"http://W.org\">W.org</a>), just make the open-source project appear unstable, dangerous to rely on and being fully controlled by a single mad despot. It poisons \"the well\" as an instance and, in a way, \"the well\" as a concept. While I want to believe that this is not a case of Matt suddenly going crazy for no reason and there must be something bad they did that set him off, what followed is completely inexcusable.</p>\n<p>Another aspect that terrifies me is watching the keynote, seeing Matt deliver it with his soft voice, smiling and making jokes, then realising this is the same person that used (in written text, so it was not just blurted out in the heat of the moment) language of utter war-time destruction <span aria-label=\"disappointed\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f61e\" role=\"img\" title=\"disappointed\">:disappointed:</span><br>\nNuclear and scorched earth is something that should be taught as a cautionary tale and not being used by a leader of an open-source project to describe how they'll use their influence and access against a competitor of their business, unless they pay a ransom. These terms are so ominous and horrible, once you realise what they literally mean <span aria-label=\"grimacing\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f62c\" role=\"img\" title=\"grimacing\">:grimacing:</span> </p>\n<p>I wish the community and the open-source project a good future, although I cannot imagine it right now.
