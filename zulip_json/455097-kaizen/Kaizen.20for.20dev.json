When it comes to kaizen I recommend Kim's Gen work (Pheonix Project, DevOps handbook and many more). The whole devops movement is very heavily inspired by Toyota, lean manufacturing, Andon Cord and dojos. Can't recommend giving them a read or a listen strongly enough!</p>",

Too bad that so many people nowadays think \"devops\" is knowing how to run a container on kubernetes or setting up a CI pipeline somewhere. It is so much more than that, and the lessons from that book and other people who tried to teach the world a better way to develop software, ended up lost. We're back to having \"devops teams\" which is exactly the opposite of what DevOps should be. Again, highly recommend both books.</p>",
