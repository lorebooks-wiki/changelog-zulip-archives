Phoenix uses some JS to accomplish that when you click on it. Hence the 404. I could fix that by making it work for both <code>POST</code> and <code>GET</code> but I do think this is a rare occasion.</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention silent\" data-user-id=\"753112\">Matt Johnson</span> <a href=\"#narrow/channel/455097-kaizen/topic/Website.20Request.20Invite.20Link/near/489012776\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does that work, does it take the email address from my <a href=\"http://changelog.com/\">changelog.com</a> account to send to a Zulip API for an invite to that email address?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes that's how it works.</p>",
