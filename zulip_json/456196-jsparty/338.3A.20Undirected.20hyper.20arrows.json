The approach reminds me of the Elm architecture, which centred IIRC around a single massive sum type with all the possible actions the user could take in the app, like Flux architecture action names. I never got to use that model in anger, it just seemed... both so sensible and so awkward to have one type for your whole app.</p>",

Of course browsers don't like you doing this, and block APIs if you're opening a local file. I also doubt mobile browsers will open local HTML files :(. But HTML files are a great place to start!</p>",
