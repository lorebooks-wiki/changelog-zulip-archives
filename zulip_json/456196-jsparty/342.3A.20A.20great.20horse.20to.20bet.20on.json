There’s a lot to love but also some challenges we don’t want to be blind to when implementing in different frameworks. Would love to have an episode with a balanced take on the state of web components. I’ve been following Cory Laviska for a few years with shoelace and now the fold into Web Awesome. Rediscovered your pod cause I was looking for web component content. Great episode! Even created an account to come plus up the web component discussion :) <br>\nbest!</p>",
