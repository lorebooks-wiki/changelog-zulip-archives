I've been trying to come up with a multiboot setup that would also allow me to do snapshots/clones and restore.  I got it working with Debian 12 and almost working with Debian 10 (Debian 12 set up my zpool with some features that 10 doesn't support... but it does <em>try</em> to boot <span aria-label=\"sweat smile\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f605\" role=\"img\" title=\"sweat smile\">:sweat_smile:</span>) </p>\n<p>Seems like a pretty slick solution. I'm starting to understand the power of the filesystem when you use it for the entire disk rather than as a bolt-on you setup after install.</p>",
