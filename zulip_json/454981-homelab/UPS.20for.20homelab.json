It's not like your power is super stable all the time, there are variances coming from turning new consumers on or off or even starting/stopping energy providers. If your country leverages solar energy, this doesn't provide a fixed supply either.<br>\nA UPS can act as buffer here, which can increase the live time of your electronic equipment.</p>",

Online UPSs do generate the AC waveform all the time but offline UPSs pass through the grid and only when voltage is out of spec they switch off the relay and start the battery inverter. Needless to say that online UPSs are more expensive and well, better.</p>",
