When I search for this I get a bunch of consumer things that want me to install an app on my phone, which I'm assuming talks to their servers.</p>\n<p>But this should be a pretty simple microcontroller + sensor + battery + wifi thing, so I don't really want to bring a random 3rd party into this. But also, I don't necessarily need to build the thing myself. So I'm wondering if homelabbers know of some off the shelf hardware that's not bound to the vendor's infrastructure in some way.</p>\n<p>Anyone monitoring metrics about their homes? What are you capturing and what are you using to do it?</p>",
