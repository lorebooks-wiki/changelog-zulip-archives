<p>Starting this new thread on Zulip and it's lack of awareness because I am simply beside myself that I've had multiple conversations with tech founders, etc in the last few weeks (since we've talked with Alya and have tried out Zulip)...<strong>and none of them know about Zulip</strong>!</p>
<p>OK, so why this new thread? Well, awareness is key for Zulip and I really believe that this realtime chat/email/forum is the bees knees and much better than Slack. Yet, no one knows about Zulip.</p>
<p>What can we (Changelog and this community) (or should we) do about this?</p>

<p>Probably the biggest one is shutting down your Slack instance and officially moving over to Zulip. That might generate some buzz. After that is talking it up in social media, blog posts, etc. It also probably wouldn't hurt to harp on the fact that Zulip isn't taking away features that used to be free like Slack does, and can be self-hosted (e.g., no AI data harvesting).</p>
<p>But honestly I can't think of anything out of the ordinary beyond talking about it regularly can convincing people to come and try it out.</p>

<p>Yes, I think shutting down our Slack will do something. Just not sure when we can do that. I know Jerod and I will be at ATO in a month and we'll likely talk about this there.</p>
<p>I have a call with Alya tomorrow afternoon about ways we can partner together and make things more official. What started as a "hey let's try this" has turned into a much easier to follow and more enjoyable community chat than I expected.</p>
<p>I'll report back here as things progress. Maybe we need to help them with some concerted marketing efforts. Anyone want to do a homepage teardown with me?</p>

<p>Having never used it, I think I came into this thinking Zulip was more message board and less chat. I see now that it's kinda more like chat with the good parts of message boards. Very happy with how topics are organized.</p>

<p>I only knew about it because there is a Rust Zulip at <a href="http://rust-lang.zulipchat.com">http://rust-lang.zulipchat.com</a>, and the topics system works well for talking about lots of different issues and features on a large, distributed, technical project. It would be unmanageable in Slack I expect.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure if it would work so well for more casual chatting, with the additional friction of having to come up with a subject, but this Changelog instance has convinced me it does.</p>
<p>If they could make it indexable by search engines that could help them a lot, because people would come across the public channels more organically in their browsers. There must be a wealth of information in the Rust Zulip that few people ever come across.</p>

<p>This is really exciting to hear. I love an underdog, especially when the underdog actually has a fantastic product!</p>
<p>I think there are situations where Slack's product decisions do make sense (eg where I work, I am not sure Zulip would be a better choice). But all too often it's just the default choice because nobody was fired for picking Salesforce. I hope you guys can help drive more awareness so that people are making informed choices not just default choices!</p>

<p>I think making public channels indexable by search engines would definitely help in adoption. I've not met anyone (online/offline) who doesn't like Zulip once they've gotten a chance to play around with it. Product is solid, it's the visibility that matters here and if people come across Zulip organically when searching for something (like in the case of Discourse), I'm sure this will create ripple effects.</p>

<p>It's like Slack, except:</p>
<p>In Slack channels are just free-flowing conversations, often with multiple conversations overlapping, questions getting lost in the noise, sometimes threads being used and sometimes not, sometimes conversations jumping back out of threads into the main channel, etc.</p>
<p>In Zulip you also have channels, but channels contain distinct "topics" which are kind of like mini, dynamic, almost transient, channels in Slack. Every conversation in the channel happens in it's own topic. It makes it easier to handle having many parallel distinct conversations, not limited by the number of channels, compared to Slack.</p>

<p>As an example, in my work Slack we have a channel called <code>platform-technical</code> for technical conversations about our platform.</p>
<p>But at some point people are deep in technical discussion, not using threads (because threads in Slack are a bit half-arsed), and you want to start another conversation. So what do you do? Well, we create a new channel called <code>platform-technical-2</code> and use that when <code>platform-technical</code> is busy. Eventually we also ended up with <code>platform-technical-3</code> for the same reason.</p>
<p>In Zulip, you can just have the one <code>platform-technical</code> channel, because all those conversations are distinct topics within the channel.</p>

<p>The coolest thing here for us (in addition to its open source-y goodness and nerdy stuff like keyboard shorcuts) is that it's much easier to find and hop in to episode-focused discussions that you listen to later than most people. In Slack it's gone (even just 90 days later) and here you just find the channel and the numbered/named topic and you can see the entire discussion, then strike up a new one if you like. That's cool.</p>

<p>I think it can be as real-time or as forum-like as you want it to be. My common complaint with Slack/Discord is that it is impossible to follow the conversation unless you're the one participating in it in real time, and complaint with Discourse is that DMs/private groups are considered second class citizens and their replies hierarchy is IMO just horrible to follow.</p>
<p>Zulip hits the sweet spot.</p>

<p>I initially thought Zulip would be a lot <em>more</em> forum-like than it is. I think I'm getting the hang of it now, but initially I expected to be able to treat topics like forum posts. There are some ways you can (eg the "recent conversations" view) but it doesn't seem to be the primary way you're expected to interact with things.</p>

<p>like i didn't pay attention to zulip for a few days and there were 200+ unread things and no obvious way to mark everything as read. and now there's tens of topics in General, but less of a forum-y way of navigating them reverse chronologically per latest messages, or to specifically alert me to new responses in threads i've interacted in (both familiar things to me from discourse)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="753684">@Dan Cardin</span> you can also "follow topic" to get notifications or "mute topic" for the opposite. I felt similarly overwhelmed when I first started using Zulip for real, but having messages in topics means I can actually choose to <em>ignore</em> a bunch of stuff when I come back and there's tons of unreads. Or at least browse messages topic by topic, rather than all unreads at once.</p>

<p>I think the answer is yes, which seems kinda odd. On the other hand, topics are content-addressed <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span> so they only keep piling up due to people discussing more things, if that makes sense. I think when I came to Zulip I thought it was more forum-like, due to topics. However, it's not really. It's not Discourse, it's closer to Slack/IRC but with just that little bit extra (topics) which help triage my inbox.</p>

<p>I am new to Changelog, the 1st episode I listened to was the long interview about Zulip. Great stuff!</p>
<p>I immediately followed the Digital Ocean link in the Zulip documentation and fired up a self-hosted Zulip instance. The fact that it simply worked (after a very long automated setup script finished) earned Zulip major kudos from me. <span aria-label="coffee" class="emoji emoji-2615" role="img" title="coffee">:coffee:</span></p>
<p>I use Slack most all day every day as part of my employment. I am also in a couple developer communities on Slack. Slack works great for our relatively small, focused team at work. However, one of the dev communities I am in has 800+ people in it and dozens of channels. It is way too easy for things to get lost in the noise. It seems like Zulip's approach could work better than Slack for large community chat.</p>
<p>My immmediate interest in Zulip was as a replacement for my church community's use of GroupMe. GroupMe is working fine for us, but there are some pitfalls--especially for a church asking students to get into the chat....and then some students getting into destructive chat relationships outside the intended community. Oops. <span aria-label="poop" class="emoji emoji-1f4a9" role="img" title="poop">:poop:</span> </p>
<p>Playing around with my Zulip instance, I like what I see. However, the <strong>show-stopper</strong> for a community (100+ people or so) is that in order to have push notifications on mobile, even with self-hosted, it's <strong>$3.50 *per user per month</strong>*. I understand it is a necessary evil, and appreciate that <a href="https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/production/mobile-push-notifications.html">Zulip explains this in great detail</a>. Yes one could compile their own versions of the native apps to enable direct push notifications, but...I'm not that hard-core. <span aria-label="upside down" class="emoji emoji-1f643" role="img" title="upside down">:upside_down:</span></p>

<p>Some feedback: I went to your website, found the Zulip episode, then clicked the Discussion link. That took me to this new Zulip chat instance. I could see the episode channels: "interviews", "friends", "practicalai", etc.</p>

<p>I think it makes sense that a new member would at least be subscribed to the same channels as the public view. It's probably normal that a person would first hit this chat anonymously and see the public view. Once they join, it's mildly disruptive to login and those episode channels are "missing"...until you unbury them and subscribe.</p>
<p>Would it make sense to at least auto-subscribe new members to the same channels as the public view? Members can unsubscribe easy enough.

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="764286">@Troy Wolf</span> do you think your community could survive on email notifications instead of mobile push? Or, I wonder to what extent the topic/inbox flow with Zulip makes push notifications less necessary, as it's easier to catch up later rather than feel the need to participate in real time.</p>

<p>I guess it depends if you expect to have a lot of discussions that are actually time-sensitive.</p>
<p>E.g. I can remember a time where I only had a Slack contact for someone and was trying to communicate about meeting them at a physical event, where it would be useful for them to get notifications!</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="752986">@Daniel Buckmaster</span> , if it were up to me, I'd be fine without push notifications for the community I'm thinking of. I wouldn't even use the native app. In my limited testing, I found that the mobile browser version of Zulip works great. On my Android chrome browser, I used the "Add to homescreen" option, which installed the "app" (I assume a PWA?). Now it feels like a native app on my phone. As long as I have that app open (background is fine), I get notified of new messages.</p>
<p>I kind of like NOT being notified unless I choose to have that app running--whether in the foreground or background. However, people seem to want push notifications.</p>
<p>As for email notification, as long as it were throttled--like tell me a channel or topic has a new message, but don't email me again until I've visited the chat--that would work for <em>me</em>. However, the community I have in mind is a lot of Jr &amp; Sr high school students. I don't know if you've noticed, but these young whipper-snappers these days don't tend to use email. <span aria-label="older man" class="emoji emoji-1f474" role="img" title="older man">:older_man:</span></p>

<p>If I expand #general, then "SHOW ALL TOPICS", it's a pretty long list. How does Zulip handle this over time? What about when there are 500 topics? Is it just one huge list to scroll through? Do the topics marked as resolved fall off into an archive or something so they aren't clogging up the list? <span aria-label="thinking" class="emoji emoji-1f914" role="img" title="thinking">:thinking:</span></p>

<p>Zulip team recently released a big upgrade to their mobile app, migrating from React Native to Flutter. I find that to be a big improvement over the old app. I'd encourage others to give it a try to see how it fares, especially if they'd tried out the old app and came away underwhelmed.</p>

<p>AirBnB did not create React Native, Meta did.  AirBnB was just a very early adopter of it. I agree with their reasons for moving away from it though.  React Native never really delivered on the promise of a good mobile experience via a single code base.  Swift and Kotlin do a far better job. It's easy to find React developers than can muddle through writing react native apps but you don't get an end product that has the same level of polish as a true native app. It's great for proving out an MVP and getting to market quickly but if you have to staff  to do so it's better long term to have separate Swift and Kotlin apps.</p>

<h3>On URLS</h3>
<p>I don't find URLs like this very readable:</p>
<p><code>/#narrow/channel/457248-applenerds/topic/Is.20there.20any.20way.20to.20fine.20tune.20find.20my.3F/with/501702223</code></p>
<p>I think you're trying to embed too much information in it. This is much better (imho):</p>
<p><code>/#/channel/applenerds/topic/501702223</code></p>
<p><em>(I'm not sure what's up with the <code>#narrow</code> part, but I'm sure there's a story there...)</em></p>
<p>Or you could go one step further and give channels primacy by assuming if there isn't a special prefix (such as <code>/dm/</code>) in the URL then it's a channel. Then it could be:</p>
<p><code>/#/applenerds/topic/501702223</code></p>
<p>And linking to a message could be:</p>
<p><code>/#/applenerds/topic/501702223/message/8675309</code></p>
<p>You could even establish a default pattern where it's always: <code>/:channel/:topic/:message</code>. Then deep-linking to a specific Zulip message would be as clean as:</p>
<p><code>/#/applenerds/501702223/8675309</code></p>
<p>I'm sure there's all kinds of technical reasons why making these kind of changes throughout the app would be difficult, and I'm not even suggesting that it's worth your while. I just know pretty URLs when I see them (GitHub is a great example of this) and Zulip lacks in that (admittedly narrow) category.</p>
<h2>On emoji</h2>
<p>The emoji picker on desktop is fine, but the mobile one is super slow to use. What's lacking from both is some kind of "recently used" or "frequently used" that is customized to you. Another way of tackling that same need is by letting people <em>sticky</em> their favorite/frequent emoji to the top/front.</p>
<p>An example: I'm a <span aria-label="green heart" class="emoji emoji-1f49a" role="img" title="green heart">:green_heart:</span> guy. I pretty much never use the red one (ok one person gets the red one, but she's not here <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span>). The red one may be popular, but I have no use for it in this context, so I have to go fetch the green one each time.</p>
<p>Each of us probably have a set of emoji that we use often enough that we'd like some more advanced features to improve the experience.</p>

<p>Heh, yeah, that's something of a legacy term for views that we have in the codebase, but no longer use in the UI.</p>

<p>For URLs, the 10.0 release has hopefully made them a lot less of a thing you need to think about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you paste a Zulip link anywhere that accepts HTML formatting (e.g., your email, GitHub, docs, etc.), the link will be automatically converted into the standard Zulip format (e.g., <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2025/03/20/zulip-10-0-released/#easier-to-link-to-zulip-content">#channel &gt; topic</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But an engineer would be in a better position to comment on what's hard easy/for the format. My guess is that the next major project related to URLs that we'd want to tackle is <a href="https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/21881">Add an option to make web-public channels search indexable #21881</a> (not currently prioritized, as it's pretty tricky).</p>

<p>I'm glad to see the commitment to change. </p>
<p>I've run a Slack with ~4k accounts but only about 300 MAUs and have been thinking about migration for at least 4 years. I'm worried about attrition among the MAUs because of "yet another chat app" feelings and that Slack is generally allowed on corporate workstations and Zulip is an unknown requiring more research and surveying to ascertain.</p>

<p>I wouldn't worry so much. The users that are actually chatting will migrate. The rest can see the read-only chat and decide to come later.</p>

<p>Folks here might be interested in a <a href="https://blog.zulip.com/2025/07/24/who-owns-your-slack-history/">blog post</a> we just published about Slack's controlling practices towards their users' message history. Slack's policies look a lot like this fictional camera app FAQ: <span aria-label="crying cat" class="emoji emoji-1f63f" role="img" title="crying cat">:crying_cat:</span> </p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><strong>Can I view my pictures any time?</strong> You can view them for 90 days for free! After that, you can sign up for a paid plan to keep access. You’ve got a year until this app starts deleting older pictures.</li>
<li><strong>Can I download my pictures?</strong> You can download the ones you’ve shared with all your friends! A paid plan is required to download the rest.</li>
<li><strong>I wrote an app to crop my ex out of my pictures. Can I use it?</strong> You can use any app in our app store.</li>
<li><strong>Can I use my app if it's not in your app store?</strong> To keep you safe, you can use your app on up to 15 photos per minute if it’s not in the app store.</li>
<li><strong>All right, how do I get my app into your app store?</strong> Submit it for review, and we’ll approve if your app is the right fit for the SnatchCam Marketplace. Make sure at least 9 of your friends already have it installed.</li>
<li><strong>I'm switching to another camera app. I’m on a paid plan — you said I can download my pictures?</strong> You need a more expensive paid plan.</li>
<li><strong>OK, I’m on the expensive plan now, let me download my photos!</strong> Your application to download your photos has been denied.</li>
</ol>
