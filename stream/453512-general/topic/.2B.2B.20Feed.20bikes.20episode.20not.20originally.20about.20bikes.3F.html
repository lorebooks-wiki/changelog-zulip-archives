<p>Weird, on my ++ feed the audio for <a href="https://changelog.com/friends/100">https://changelog.com/friends/100</a> had an interview with the guy making the vibes site (cant remember his name), then I deleted that episode in overcast, downloaded it again, and its the correct audio about bikes. Anyway, looking forward to the bikes episode ...</p>

<p>Haha yeah we uploaded the wrong audio at first, then fixed it but apps that already had the mp3 local need to delete and re-download (there's no way to tell podcast apps to update your file, sadly)</p>
