<p>I see several technologies that are maturing at the same time. I know Silicon Valley (place not show) is all about AI at the moment. I see the value, but I've been a little more skeptical of its long-term value insofar as it changes our lives for the better.</p>
<p>Among the trending technologies, these ones stick out to me, but there are plenty more:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasm </li>
<li>Local-first applications</li>
<li>Generative AI</li>
</ul>
<p>For me, I think Wasm has a huge potential to disrupt the cloud-native ecosystem. I think we'll see more companies pick it up as a model for deploying their applications safely and efficiently. However, it may be too limiting for certain use cases. I know I can't use it for my current project because I rely on a Git binary in my runtime environment. I'm still looking for the right project to use Wasm in. At work though, we enable users to run their own Wasm as part of a Kafka pipeline in process (Redpanda).</p>
<p>I'm even more excited about local-first applications like Linear and others. I think it offers a genuinely novel way of both developing and using apps that is way better for users. I've completely moved off of Notion and onto Obsidian for this very reason. I think we'll see a new generation of applications using local first to eat the lunch of existing juggernauts like Atlassian, Google Docs, and Notion.</p>

<p>It's a very long-term vision so probably not what you were thinking of for this topic, but I recently learned about Dynamicland and really love the vision of the future they have.</p>
<p>I've seen people (read: tech bros) get really inspired by Tony Stark's lab in the Iron Man films and think that's the future of tech. Dynamicland feels to me like that, but if it were invented by your friendly neighbourhood anarchist instead of a billionaire arms dealer <span aria-label="joy" class="emoji emoji-1f602" role="img" title="joy">:joy:</span></p>

<p>I think embedded devices will become more important as they become more accessible to program. It's easier to create devices for home automation and other monitoring needs. I'd like to see a shift from proprietary embedded devices that have zero right to repair onto open hardware/software that you can extend or replace with your own devices.</p>

<p>There's no hard and fast rules here. I think of this from the perspective of a developer, but the scope could be broader. I think Wasm will mostly impact developers, but if it leads to faster services for users, that would be a promising non-dev benefit. Local-first, I believe has a very broad benefit for all users.</p>

<p>I think that local-first is something that end users care about sometimes, but may not understand that they do. It might just be the difference between an app that has a spinner on every interaction versus an app that responds instantly. Or, an app that works well with limited connectivity- which could be important in certain B2B scenarios, e.g. we have customers who travel around rural areas a fair bit.</p>

<p>I'm totally aligned here too. WASM, right-to-repair, ARM laptops, Ollama, embedded devices all signal to me a cultural (consumer and developer) shift towards local first. I think combined with this is an ever growing awareness of online privacy and security, and a degradation of trust in corporations and media. </p>
<p>All in all, it feels a bit like people are taking a cautionary step back from everything. And part of that is the protectionism of having and being able to maintain / build your own stuff.</p>

<p>And speaking of "limited connectivity" this is applies to accessing a website _anywhere_ in Australia. When I was there on an extended visit, I wrote up a little git wrapper for my dotfile management to (among other things) push my repo to the origin and mirror concurrently, so I didn't have to wait so long. It was long enough!</p>

<p>I am of the opinion that wasm is amongst the list of technologies that's 80% there but the remaining 20% will cause you heartbreak and pain and therefore the use will be limited.  There are just too many restrictions in the sandbox.   It also smells a bit too much like the JVM at the moment. </p>

<p>I don’t know if this is a trend, but I’m trying to steer my career more toward smaller devices deployed out in the world. Writing in a more constrained environment is a fun challenge that gives me an excuse to be closer to the metal. Also no one’s asked me to add any useless AI features. (And the AI features I’m anticipating are actually interesting and worthwhile.)</p>

<p>After the DHH episode I decided to try ruby again after a very long hiatus. I didn't want to write a rails app (yet) so I decided to write a little app to manage my dotfiles the way I want them managed.  So far it's been fun. I am basically recreating something like ansible but of course super light. What's interesting is that the language is directing me to create a DSL for managing my files and makes it so easy to experiment with the language.  The code just seems to flow out of you because I just type what I think should work and 90% of the time it just does. Of course the codeium code completion really helps a lot here. </p>
<p>In an ideal world there would be a ruby interpreter that would be a single binary so I could just put it in the same directory as my dotfiles and execute them but OSX and Linux come with ruby already installed so it's not that big of a deal.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="752986">@Daniel Buckmaster</span> it really depends on what you're trying to solve, stateful/stateless backends are "solutions" not problems, if you aproach it's more like a X Y problem.</p>
<p>there are a few solutions in erlang/elixir that are quite easier because you already have abstractions that are "cluster transparent",  so once you cluster multiple backend instances, communicating between processes are transparent, you do it in the same way you'd do if they were in the same machine.  but it really depends on what you need</p>

<p>from what i understand any background job solution would take care of "durable execution"... in Elixir in particular you can solve that with asynchronous tasks, remote execution, or even Oban(background job backed by postgres). it would be even simple to connect oban execution to cycle to a pubsub and have it reported in real time in the FE.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's pretty common functionality for a background job solution. As I mentioned above, the difference between a background job and a durable execution (at least as far as I understand it) is that the retrying/chaining behavior is at the job level for a background job, whereas a durable execution is guaranteeing the execution within the job.</p>
<p>In theory, I think it's possible to model a durable execution inside something like Oban, but it would mean isolating anything state related into it's own job. </p>
<p>It's the difference between </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>// job1
const job1(cliArgs) {
let user = &quot;Adele Goldberg&quot;;
let comic_id: u32 = flawless::rand::random();
let url = format!(&quot;https://xkcd.com/{comic_id}/&quot;);
let content = flawless_http::get(url).send();
let quote = parse_comic(content);
let greeting = format!(&quot;Hi {user}! // &#39;{quote}&#39;&quot;)
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Where each of the flawless commands will retain the first execution's result even if the job reruns.</p>
<p>Versus</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>// background job
const job1(cliArgs) {
let user = &quot;Adele Goldberg&quot;;
let comic_id: u32 = flawless::rand::random();

const job2(cliArgs) {
let url = format!(&quot;https://xkcd.com/{comic_id}/&quot;);
let content = flawless_http::get(url).send();
}

const job3(cliArgs) {
let quote = parse_comic(content);
let greeting = format!(&quot;Hi {user}! // &#39;{quote}&#39;&quot;)

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="756209">@Dustin</span> yes so Oban is not stricte durable execution of course, but it really depends on what you want to achieve. because parts of your job might be just retried on each job retry run if they are read-only, or the state might be saved to your data source of truth.</p>

<p>Maybe I should have watched this earlier <span aria-label="grinning" class="emoji emoji-1f600" role="img" title="grinning">:grinning:</span> I think we're actually saying the same things. All I was trying to say is the promises of durable execution is not something unique to a language or tool but it is a certain kind of abstraction that isn't given to you by something like Oban. You'd have to craft your code in a particular style to achieve that.</p>

<p>I agree... my point is that the language/runtime allows you to model the solutions with different abstractions, some more simple than the others.</p>

<p>Back on the topic of Wasm I really think it has potential to make a huge impact in software distribution. If you think about the web as an app distribution platform it has incredible UX - you go to a link and it downloads all the dependencies (some of which are probably already cached), JIT compiles write once, run anywhere software (JavaScript), and runs it all in a sandbox so you can be reasonably confident that your computer won’t be hijacked my malware (today anyway). Additionally the browser provides a common (though very opinionated) graphics framework, accessibility, etc.</p>
<p>One of the reasons this works so well is the sandboxing - if you look at most other software distribution platforms there is either a high bar or hurdles for what they will distribute (think Debian packages or windows software signing) or have a questionable supply chain (NPM) </p>
<p>If you wanted to build a new app delivery paradigm Wasm has all of the ideal properties - it’s truly WORA, is a compilation target for many popular languages, has a really solid sandbox design, native-ish performance, you can define the environment (e.g. provide OpenGL bindings) and everything happens in user space which is amazing! (in comparison to docker which requires a Linux kernel running with namespaces, groups, etc.).</p>
<p>So what I envision is an app “browser” if you will where I could type e.g. wasm-run <a href="https://ziglang.org/wasm/latest">https://ziglang.org/wasm/latest</a> --arg1 … and boom everything downloads and I have the latest zig compiler running in a sandboxed environment in seconds regardless of the platform. Or you could even provide gui apps like games, spreadsheet software, etc. through the same method.</p>
<p>Anyway, this is a long-winded way of saying that I’m also bullish on Wasm if people can appreciate that it’s not just for web or just another standard take on a language VM</p>

<p>All this talk reminds that we are all trying to reinvent JVM and J2EE and Applets.  I remember back in the bad old days writing applets that had rich front end interactivity. Sure it took forever to load and froze your browser while loading but once it loaded it was great. I remember being able to create a WAR file and uploading the app via a browser to a J2EE container where it magically upgraded an existing app and the container provided a cache, KV store, configuration, database , queue etc.  You could also write your app in different languages because they had groovy, jruby, javascript, python etc running on the JVM back then.  Just like Kubernetes does today but more messy.</p>
<p>WASM is the new JVM, so I look forward to somebody creating the equivalent of J2EE  container or kubernetes for WASM. Everything old will become new again because our industry loves reinventing everything.</p>

<p>Apparently there's also research for the browser use case, to try and be able to chunk wasm blobs by component boundaries so that you don't have to load the entire binary in a single call (even if it is streamable!) But, I'm not even sure if the wasm component was agreed upon yet. Still early days for wasm!</p>

<p>I can't remember the interview (might have been a Change Log episode) but there was a suggestion that browsers / WHATWG could (in the far off future) make WASM the only supported runtime, but retain JavaScript compatibility by implementing V8/JavaScriptCore/SpiderMonkey on top of WASM<br>
JS would be on equal footing to every other language that can run or compile to WASM</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755905">@Tim Uckun</span> what do you think the web platform is missing to bring back the applets experience? Browsers have cache, KV store, database etc even without WASM. (Though of course we are still at the mercy of whether browsers implement these specs fully or usefully!)</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="752986">@Daniel Buckmaster</span> I guess browsers have already brought a lot of what applets offered into the browser itself including stateful connections and graphics. It all seems a lot more clumsy to develop in though. Applets were pretty straightforward java (whatever that means to you)</p>
