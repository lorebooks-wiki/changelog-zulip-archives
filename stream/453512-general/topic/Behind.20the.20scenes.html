<p>Just throwing this out there for Adam and Jerod - I’d love a “behind the scenes” episode on the podcast. I’m always wondering how you guys can keep such a grueling pace and pump out so much content for so long. How do you stay on top of your interview pipeline, edit episodes, research content for news, work with advertisers, spend time coding, try new tech, homelab, BBQ, spend time with family (6 kids, Jerod!), rewatch Silicon Valley, etc. and stay sane? A glimpse into your process would be awesome.</p>

<p>I'm in the same boat, would love to know more!</p>

<p>Yes! Although you said you don't much like navel gazing, I think many of us are interested in how the sausage is made <span aria-label="grinning face with smiling eyes" class="emoji emoji-1f601" role="img" title="grinning face with smiling eyes">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span> <br>
I remember there was a segment about the production process in Friends #61, but a deeper dive into the process and what surrounds it would be interesting.</p>

<p>Not sure what we could do that would be better than <a href="https://changelog.com/friends/61">Friends 61</a> (starting at chapter 11) and not end up being a combination of boring + boastful...</p>
<p>Maybe if there were specific questions we could answer on the show, that'd make it more directed and useful to people?</p>
