<p>Listening to Steve Yegge conversation triggered a thought for me. One place where AI could really be useful in helping the elderly. My aunt is starting the suffer from dementia and is currently aware enough to call my mom constantly to check on herself, to ask questions, etc.  It would be so great if there was an AI of sorts that she could ask questions to or to remind her of things she needs to do like take her medication etc.  I bought my mom an apple watch and it came in really handy one time when she fell, she was able to ask her watch to call for help and it did.  I really hope Apple Intelligence moves in this direction. Everybody could use an assistant.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755905">@Tim Uckun</span>  I don't use a smart watch, but I believe Samsung watches with WearOS has good health features  and a variety of third-party apps for use cases.</p>
