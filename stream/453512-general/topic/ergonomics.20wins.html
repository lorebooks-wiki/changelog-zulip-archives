<p>Tangent thread inspired by Changelog Interviews #608 about ergonomic keyboards: Erez spoke about how ergonomics is less about finding "the right ergonomic keyboard", and more about making a series of adjustments that make sense <em>for you</em>.</p>
<p>So <strong>what are some of your personal ergonomics wins?</strong></p>
<p>My biggest wins have been around wrist strain - the combination of a Moonlander keyboard w/platform for more tent control, Kensington Expert Mouse trackball and Vivo clamp-on arm rests. Wrists are happy whether standing or sitting nowadays, and it's a beautiful thing.</p>

<p>That's very helpful, tysm!

<p>Heh.I'm glad to find apparently the one other person who feels that way! I sort of reluctantly waded into the mechanical keyboard world because my old MS ergo keyboards all finally died, and I didn't like the newer ones.

<p>Hahaha I've been in the MK world for over a decade now, which is scary when I think about it. But I've been using a HHKB layout for something like 6-7 years (totally agree with Jerod on CTRL being in the normal Caps Lock position) and have very little wrist/hand pain, so I haven't gone into the ergo world. The fact that I don't need to move my hands too much while typing seems to help a ton</p>

<p>Are you saying here that Caps Lock should be where Ctrl is, or are you really saying Ctrl should be where Caps Lock is? I just ask because usually I see people say that Caps Lock is fairly useless but in a convenient position, so they replace it with something like Layer Toggle (or I guess Ctrl).</p>

<p>That mouse was awful.  The crazier bit, if I recall correctly,  was that unplugging the keyboard while the workstation was running would cause it to freeze.  That would have been on... I think a Sparcstation 4, and Solaris 2.5.</p>

<p>I think your question holds the answer. This is different than Slack. Many people don't like the ergonomics of Slack and the multi-account architecture. Also, Slack is not friendly to free-tier users and/or communities. There's no "plan" for them. Changelog discusses their motivation to spin up Zulip a bit in the following episodes.</p>

<p>I <em>loved</em> my Preonic keyboard. I switched from a standard keyboard to the Preonic and loved the linear layout and small form factor. However I have wide shoulders so I began to notice discomfort in my shoulders due to how close my hands and arms were when using the Preonic. I then switched to the Moonlander as my first split keyboard and it's been pretty good overall. It can be adjusted to my liking and the split nature is perfect for my shoulders and posture. No more discomfort.</p>
<p>I do wish the Moonlander had:</p>
<ul>
<li>A extra key on the thumb cluster. The large double-width red key could easily be 2 single-width keys like the Kinesis. This would allow someone to put Ctrl, Alt, Super on both clusters.</li>
<li>A concave layout. I <em>really</em> liked testing out the Kinesis. My fingers rested in the concave bowl and typing was a breeze. I think a Moonlander V2 could go this route and be successful.</li>
</ul>

I think that would be too much to handle for me, I am currently thinking about replacing my old logitech keyboard. I have no pain so far, but I want it to keep it that way... <br>
The ZSA gear looks really tempting, but it is really expensive to get in Germany... customs will add around 80€ of costs... so, depending on the current currency conversion rates, I am looking at about 408€ in total... without ever having a mechanical keyboard before, and I'm not sure how well I would handle the transition. There is rarely any second-hand market either...<br>
Does anyone have good alternatives for German citizens? I am willing to spend a bit more, but I think somewhere around 300€ would be my limit I would be comfortable to spend.</p>

<p>I've been using a Glove80 (<a href="https://www.moergo.com/">https://www.moergo.com/</a>) for about a year and I absolutely love it.</p>
<p>After some research, I decided I wanted a split and tented keyboard, with a concave key-well. I ordered a Scylla DIY kit from Bastard Keyboards (<a href="https://bastardkb.com/">https://bastardkb.com/</a>) but for several reasons it just sat in its box and I never put it together.</p>
<p>Not long after I found the Glove80, and it seemed to check all the boxes for me, so I decided to give it a try. I couldn't be happier.</p>
<p>I was starting to feel some pain in my wrists and getting symptoms of possible initial carpal tunnel inflammation (tingly sensation on my fingers). Those are now gone and my typing posture is so much more comfortable!</p>
<p>But the keyboard was just one of the ergonomics wins. I also got a standing desk and a treadmill underneath it, I raised the height of the computer screens to be more aligned with the height of my eyes, and decided on a new chair to buy (haven't bought it yet). All of this has made it much more bearable to work sitting at a desk.</p>

<p>Doesn't a trackball force you to move your fingers more, though? With a traditional mouse, you only move your wrist. I suppose they cater to different needs: for people who have carpal tunnel issues, a regular mouse might be a better choice, whereas for someone who suffers from wrist/elbow/shoulder pain the trackball is more appropriate because it limits the motion of those joints. Does that make sense?</p>

<p>Oh, and I forgot to mention that I also have a Logitech mx vertical mouse, which also eliminated the strain on my mouse hand wrist. Changing the angle my forearms rest on the table was probably my biggest win in terms of ergonomics.</p>

<p>Can highly recommend taking time to get a good desk chair for the mouse problem too. I have the Steelcase Gesture, which has quite a bit of range in all directions for the arm rests. I can comfortably sit my forearms on the arm rests, which keeps them at the right level for the Moonlander. </p>
<p>But when I do need to move to the mouse, I can pivot my forearm, which doesn't use the traps / shoulder at all. Reduces strain a lot.</p>
<p>Can also highly recommend <code>skhd</code> and <code>yabai</code> to cut down a lot of mousing (Mac specific). And firefox + tridactyl, and neovim of course. I count those as (time) investments in ergonomics.</p>

<p>Yep, however! I'm pretty sure it's still the case that the DHL delivery person _also_ needs €6 for the DHL processing fee. This is additional to the actual import tax (which is paid online)... And they only take it in cash! Otherwise the parcel goes back to a major post shop... Thought this was a scam the first time it happened to me.</p>
<p>Keep an eye on kleinanzeigen too. I've seen Moonlanders pop up on occasion. Maybe voyagers will start to soon as well.</p>

<p>Thanks, yeah, we are quite spoiled with the  Amazon delivery process... but I also fully understand that companies avoid selling on Amazon, especially if they are selling more niche products. <br>
I would really like to have some stores to try it before buying, or maybe an option to rent and buy eventually, but I guess ergo custom boards are an expensive hobby, it is what it is <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>
<p>When I take into consideration what it takes to build a board with that level of  functions ... probably 365$ is a fair price. Including customs, the end price will end up to around 450€ if I am not mistaken... <br>
Still, if I build my own, it might end up in that price range as well, and the quality might not be that great in comparison. It might pay off if you plan to keep building boards, but I am not seeing me doing that in the near future<span aria-label="laughing" class="emoji emoji-1f606" role="img" title="laughing">:laughing:</span></p>

<p>It arrived on Friday, I did not have super much time to play with it, but my first impression is really good. Nice build quality, and everything is customizable AND works with Fedora. With current currency conversion and customs on top, I paid 412.14€. It's not cheap, but if it is really that good, it might still be worth the price. Shipping already costs around 90$, I think, so they don't really get that much for their work... customs were 77,22€ in my case.</p>

<p>I tried the Logitech K860 for a few days a couple years ago and it is really good. Unfortunately I couldn't get one with a Portuguese layout, so now I didn't buy one for my girlfriend. The Microsoft Sculpt is also quite nice, though I was only able to get it as a kit with a mouse that isn't bad but is light-years away from the Logitech vertical mouse. Also, it forces you to use both the mouse and the keyboard, the keyboard alone doesn't work. And it's not Bluetooth, you have to use the proprietary MS dongle that comes with it, meaning that if you lose it, you toss everything out the window. Both units use replaceable batteries, which is a very positive aspect.</p>

<p>A couple cheaper (but still in the €300 range) alternatives to the ZSA keyboards are the Glove80 and the Dygma. They're both very good. I use a Glove80 and absolutely love it, it's super comfortable, customisable, can be used wired or wirelessly via bluetooth, and it's just great. The Dygma is also very nice but doesn't have a concave key well, which was the decisimg factor for me, making it less ergonomic. On the flip side, because it's flat, it's a little easier to carry. The Dygma also doesn't have both wired and wireless in the same unit, if I recall correctly. You have to pick one or the other.</p>

<p>Yeah, logitech is not really flexible. You can't tweak much, and changing key caps is probably not possible either, as it is not a mechanical keyboard. <br>
Personally, I also thought it was a bit too wide... the mouse is quite far away, but due to the split arrangement, it requires that space, and they still kept the num pad.<br>

<p>I am not against having a num pad in general, on the voyager I need to press a layer switch which will just light up the keys used for the numbers. I can use the num pad that way without requiring permanent keys and space for it.</p>

At least programmable layouts are really great if you are programming and use language layouts that don't map special characters to reachable positions.<br>
I used german layouts so far, and when I am programming, I need to stretch quite a bit for all these types of brackets. Now, they are all on the home row or one line up or down on my second layer.<br>
I still figure out some characters as I go, but I could also get rid of unused keys like caps lock... it was just a key I hit by accident on a usual board, which was never useful to me.

<p>Ah, ok, that might help, I think changing one thing at a time is probably the option to stay productive while doing the transition.

I wasn't that bold and picked the first approach.<br>
What helped me was to open their app keymapp on my laptop screen while working on my main screen. The usual characters were not that hard to memorize, and you could also put proper keycaps on those. But for special characters, I am not fully certain all the time.<br>
I ensured that I could type my password without any help, and afterward, I could rely on their app to help me find keys until I had them fully memorized.<br>
The heat map function is also interesting to optimize your layout for your use case. If too many hits happen to far away from your home row, consider swapping them.</p>

<p>One little thing... if you're doing a lot of iterations on your layout, it's super handy to have a binding for the keyboard reset key so you can flash without having to hit the little paperclip reset button.

<p>I was also convinced to get a ZSA Voyager from the Erez Zukermak podcast. I started having pain in my pinkies from using shift, control, and enter. I knew something needed to change and the show was a nice point in the right direction. The first 2 weeks I spent getting use to the keyboard. After viewing the keyboard heatmap I decided to try switching to Colemak. With QWERTY, I spent a lot of time not on the home row. I'm still learning the new layout, but my hand pain has gone away.  </p>
<p>I checked out <a href="https://keeb.io/products/iris-ce-keyboard">Keebio Iris CE</a> this week. Their keyboard also felt really nice. They use choco switches (same as Voyager), but the keycaps are slightly smaller and, therefore closer together.</p>
