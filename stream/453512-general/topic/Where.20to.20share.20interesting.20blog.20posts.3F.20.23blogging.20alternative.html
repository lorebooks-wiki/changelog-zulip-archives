<p>On Slack, we had #general and #blogging for dropping in interesting links from time to time - sometimes it generated some good discussion, but sometimes it didn't. How's best to share these things, here?</p>

<p>Good question!</p>
<p>The challenge with naming things (channels, in this case) is you think a name is appropriately scoped, but then here comes a new use-case...</p>
<p>Example: <a class="stream" data-stream-id="460285" href="/#narrow/stream/460285-tv-movies">#tv-movies</a> is "A place to discuss media", but let's say I come across an awesome video on YouTube that I'd like to share. Is it tv? Is it a movie? Do I go against the channel's grain or do I start a new one called #other-videos-that-arent-tv-or-movies?</p>
<p>I suggest (open to discussion, of course) that we try to organize around specific-yet-generic verbs for channels and see how that works. So we might create:</p>
<ul>
<li>#reading (post about things you're reading or think others might enjoy)</li>
<li>#writing (post about the art/craft of... writing)</li>
<li>#watching (we could rename <a class="stream" data-stream-id="460285" href="/#narrow/stream/460285-tv-movies">#tv-movies</a> to this)</li>
<li>#listening (maybe for non-changelog-specific podcasts, music, I dunno this one might be bad)</li>
</ul>
<p>Has anybody ever tried organizing discussions this way? Might it work well?</p>

<p>I like this idea! I had the same thought as Jamie yesterday but in relation to the <a class="stream" data-stream-id="460285" href="/#narrow/stream/460285-tv-movies">#tv-movies</a> channel we had in Slack... so I went and created it, but maybe I shouldn't have <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span> </p>
<p>If we went this route, we could rename <a class="stream" data-stream-id="459184" href="/#narrow/stream/459184-bookclub">#bookclub</a> into #reading. One thing I'd say is a #writing channel would probably be pretty quiet most of the time, and if you've written a blog post, it might be confusing whether to put that in #reading or #writing... maybe the producer and consumer side of these get collapsed into just one, and separated by topics?</p>

<p>I think that is a good idea worth exploring! If some topic or group of topics get popular enough, it could potentially move to a separate channel, and new use cases would still have a home in the more generic channel.</p>
<p>I do not see much co fusion between #reading and #writing - if I am interested in feedback or exposure to the content, that would go into #reading, and if I was more intersted in discussing how to convey certain information, adress certain target groups or write certain types of material, that would go into #writing.<br>
Even discussing tools to support writing/documentation processes would fit into #writing I think.</p>

<p>#writing might be too narrowly scoped. Perhaps a more general #content-creation?</p>

<p>My impression of Zulip is that very broad categories should apply to channels, and manage scope with topics, then if a particular topic generates a lot of ongoing interest, break that into its own channel</p>

<p>The way they describe it in official docs/marketing is that channels determine who sees a message, and the topic is what the message is, well, about. E.g. here <a href="https://zulip.com/why-zulip/#zulips-unique-topic-based-threading-model-makes-efficient-communication-possible-heres-how">https://zulip.com/why-zulip/#zulips-unique-topic-based-threading-model-makes-efficient-communication-possible-heres-how</a></p>
<p>So I guess that implies some sort of channel structure based on audiences? But that seems less straightforward outside a work/project context, where we're here just as a group of people hanging out based on a big shared Venn diagram of overlapping interests.</p>

<p><a href="#narrow/channel/453512-general/topic/new.20channels/near/474035664">Last time I asked about a new channel</a>, someone suggested I just make a topic in #general, which is what I did.<br>
What about making a topic for your post containing the word <code>#blogging</code> in the title? Then if anyone wants to search for all blog related topics, they can search for the term <code>"#blogging"</code> in global search and find everything?<br>
That might also help admins move topics later if a blogging channel gets created :)</p>
