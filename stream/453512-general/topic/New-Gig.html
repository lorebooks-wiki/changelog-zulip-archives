<p>Hello Everyone, hope you guys are doing well.<br>
I run a small remote dev shop. We build solid stuff: AI, Cloud, Web/Mobile, CMS (Shopify/WordPress/Wix), Designs, Data work… the kind that actually ships and doesn’t fall apart a month later<span aria-label="smile" class="emoji emoji-1f604" role="img" title="smile">:smile:</span><br>
But we’ve got a funny problem…<br>
We’re like a kitchen full of great chefs… and nobody loves walking out to the dining room to explain the menu.<br>
US clients usually love what we build, but interviews can get a little awkward because of language + cultural rhythm.<br>
So I’m looking for a US/Canada/UK/LatAm-based partner who’s comfortable talking with people and can be the friendly face on client calls.<br>
Simple setup:<br>
You handle the client-facing side (calls, clarifying needs, keeping the relationship smooth)<br>
I handle 100% of the technical work (architecture, coding, delivery)<br>
You earn 25–30% revenue share for each project you support<br>
And to be super clear: this isn’t a heavy tech job. You don’t have to code — just be a clear communicator.<br>
Also — important note: you can use your own brand/name.<br>
 Some people don’t feel comfortable speaking under someone else’s identity (totally fair). If that’s you, we can onboard you officially so you can show up as yourself in every meeting and still keep the partnership model.<br>
We had a NYC-based partner for over a year — great run — and he ended up getting hired full-time by one of our clients (best exit story honestly).<br>
So now that seat is open again.<br>
If you’re down for a chill side gig that won’t wreck your schedule — and you like the idea of building something long-term — send me a message and I’ll share the details.<br>
If it’s not your vibe, no worries at all !<span aria-label="folded hands" class="emoji emoji-1f64f" role="img" title="folded hands">:folded_hands:</span><br>
If you are interested, DM me or message me on WhatsApp: +1 (702) 232-0366<br>
Or send message to <a href="mailto:winblueforest@gmail.com">winblueforest@gmail.com</a><br>
Appreciate your reading  <span aria-label="raised hands" class="emoji emoji-1f64c" role="img" title="raised hands">:raised_hands:</span></p>
