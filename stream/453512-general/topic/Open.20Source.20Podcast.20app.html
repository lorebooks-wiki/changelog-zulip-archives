<p>Hey changelog crew <span aria-label="wave" class="emoji emoji-1f44b" role="img" title="wave">:wave:</span> Jamie here, longtime listener and general podcast fan.<br>
Just wanted to share a little project I've been working on...</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/JamieCurnow/Podcasts">https://github.com/JamieCurnow/Podcasts</a><br>
It's an open source podcast app <span aria-label="tada" class="emoji emoji-1f389" role="img" title="tada">:tada:</span></p>
<p>Demo app running here:<br>
<a href="https://lovepodcasts.com/">https://lovepodcasts.com/</a></p>
<p>I started it a while ago and it's become my daily driver for listening to pods.</p>
<p>It's completely RSS-driven, there are no ads, no tracking, no signup (!) and it's completely open source <span aria-label="relieved" class="emoji emoji-1f60c" role="img" title="relieved">:relieved:</span><br>
It runs on the web and as a PWA that can be installed anywhere. All data persisted in local storage <span aria-label="glowing star" class="emoji emoji-1f31f" role="img" title="glowing star">:glowing_star:</span></p>
<p>Stack: Vue/Nuxt (typescript <span aria-label="ok" class="emoji emoji-1f44c" role="img" title="ok">:ok:</span>)</p>
<p>It's all about putting the listener in control. And taking advantage of the purity of RSS and the open web <span aria-label="heart hands" class="emoji emoji-1faf6" role="img" title="heart hands">:heart_hands:</span></p>
<p>It's still early days, but I'm really excited about its potential. I'd love for you to check it out, give me your thoughts, or even contribute if you're interested <span aria-label="blush" class="emoji emoji-1f60a" role="img" title="blush">:blush:</span></p>
<p>Standout feature:<br>
Chapters support! <span aria-label="muscle" class="emoji emoji-1f4aa" role="img" title="muscle">:muscle:</span><br>
And I'm working on some best-shot parsing of podcast descriptions for pods that don't put the chapters in the XML but put them free-text in descriptions. The one I've done this with which is a game changer is the Lex Fridman pod.</p>
<p>And also some advice please <span aria-label="folded hands" class="emoji emoji-1f64f" role="img" title="folded hands">:folded_hands:</span> what license should I use? It's a minefield! I've landed on GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL) for starters <span aria-label="face with monocle" class="emoji emoji-1f9d0" role="img" title="face with monocle">:face_with_monocle:</span></p>
<p>Thanks for all the great content you produce!<br>
Jamie</p>

<p>Hey. This looks pretty cool but here is some input if you want it.</p>
<p>I listen to podcasts mostly in my car and I live in NZ so mobile bandwidth is really expensive to me.  My two most important features in a podcast app are downloading the podcasts only on wifi,  and an intuitive easy to use GUI when I am driving, and apple car play integration.</p>
<p>I don't think PWAs can download podcasts only on wifi but if you ever decide to push this and make it an app it's something to consider.</p>
