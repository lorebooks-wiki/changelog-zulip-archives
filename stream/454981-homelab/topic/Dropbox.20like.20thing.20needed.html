<p>I did a little rant about my WTF experience with dropbox so I am looking for an alternative. The reason I am using dropbox are the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Generous free tier, I am not paying for it. Having said that MEGA gives you more for free.</li>
<li>Seamless sync on the mac and phone. </li>
<li>WebDav like feature so I don't have to host all the files on all the machines. </li>
<li>Being able to wipe the folders from a machine remotely. I really want this in case I lose my laptop or it's stolen. I want to be able to log in and say "remove this device and wipe all the files on it" and have it do it.</li>
</ol>
<p>AFIK dropbox is the only thing that offers that 4th feature. </p>
<p>Any advice?</p>

<p>You don't want to go lower level like AWS S3 or CloudFlare R2?</p>

<p>I thought about that but I would have to code up the function I want which would somehow get a signal from someplace and wipe the local drive in case I lose my laptop or get it stolen. Also I kind of like the idea of webdav in that I don't necessarily want all the files on all the machines all the time. </p>
<p>I know, I know, I could always encrypt the hard drive and yea I might have to do that if I can't find a decent alternative.</p>
