<p>This one was kind of meandering. I think a little tighter focus would have made the episode better.</p>
<p>Two thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have been in the industry for decades and the number of developers I have interacted with that care about ethernet frames or packet sizes was less than ten.  </li>
<li>You are not a lynchpin for anybody except your family. In capitalism we measure value with dollars and anybody who tells you they depend on you should not be believed unless they are paying you. They value your code in proportion to what they are paying you. If they are paying you zero dollars they don't value your work at all and any claims saying how much you owe them should be dismissed out of hand. You don't owe anybody anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>People generally don't care about the details but I have seen some people get caught up in the details just enough to freeze and stop learning and being productive. It takes just one more layer to learn to end someone's journey.</p>

<p>The discussion was about you somehow writing some code either as open source or in a company and then being obligated to maintain it and it being a burden. You guys mentioned some log4j and some other products.</p>
<p>My point is that open source authors don't owe anybody anything. If you don't want to maintain it anymore, don't. Look at boltdb for example. If somebody values it they should pay you to maintain it. If they are not paying they don't value it.  i guess somebody took over boltdb, forked it and life goes on for everybody. It wasn't a lynchpin at all.</p>

<p>I'll say one more thing that might be unpopular.</p>
<p>In every team you need different types of people. You can't have a basketball team full of Michael Jordans, you need a Dennis Rodman and a Scottie Pippen and a Steve Kerr etc to form a championship team.  You need those "nine to five" devs who can sit down and plow through the tickets and get stuff done. Who don't want to re-architect the code or change how things work or even care about all that.  You need unproductive juniors, you need crazy thinkers, and you need nose to the ground get crap done devs.   As a manager it's your job to put this team together and to make sure they work as a well oiled machine. I don't care if every member of my team is constantly learning  new and esoteric things. Some should but honestly most don't need to at all. If I have a codebase to maintain that's making money for the company the last thing I want is to rewrite it or re architect it or whatever.</p>

<p>No one owes anyone anything, correct. There is hesitation to put things out there in public because there will be people creating issues, treating it load bearing, or just being mean in comments. That hesitation prevents people from wanting to contribute or write open source code. Then there's the opposite mentality where the maintainer expects payment for their work even though it was released for free.</p>
<p>I don't think it's strictly always true that if someone doesn't pay for something it's not valuable. Most people don't pay for Linux or Git and those are quite valuable to many people. Heck, most people don't pay for a programming language and we make a living with it.</p>

<p>If we value it then we should pay for it. Somehow, some way. I think the reason people don't pay is because they just don't value it that much. If linux went away they would switch to something else, if go went away they would switch to rust or whatever. Of course some companies are invested in the success of Linux and Go and that's why they pay for it. We are just freeloaders :)</p>

<p>I think paying for something with money is one way to show that you value it but that doesn't strictly mean you value it. I pay money to ride the train but I don't value it, it's just the most efficient for my time which I value more than the train.</p>
<p>Spending time with something is another way to show you value it. One can argue that's "paying" with your time. Point is I don't think everything of value needs to be traded for money.</p>
<p>And yes, of course when things go away there's an opportunity to replace it with something else to fill that void. Doesn't mean the original thing wasn't valuable.</p>

<p>Here is a vision to consider.</p>
<p>A software delivery mechanism based on a blockchain like database. You put your packages there and dependencies are fetched from there.  This would solve a lot of problems because packages would be immutable and ownership would be verifiable so hijacking packages for nefarious purposes, clear tracking of uploads etc.</p>
<p>Each author sets a price for their software or package. You pay when you fetch it. If you think it costs too much you use something else. If people like your free package you can charge more for the next version while the people can continue to fetch the previous version for free.</p>

<p>Immutable content-addressed packages are a great idea<br>
It doesn't really need block-chain though, any package repository that exists today could add this as a feature<br>
I'd also love repeatable and reproducible builds, so we can tell which commit in the package source produces the distributed package</p>
