<p>I used to work for a company that had an analytics product. We would produce wonderful graphs and reports for people but most business people had a lot of difficulty making use of the dashboards. They couldn't understand what the significance of two lines converging on a graph meant when the data scientist that put together the graph knew the significance even though he had limited domain knowledge.</p>
<p>We ended up selling an add on where our data scientists would actually look at their graphs and make a weekly written report to send to the managers and that turned out to be a big hit.</p>
<p>In the end I don't think people even want to look at dashboards or charts. They just want to be told what's going on. This is where the AI can really help I think. Skip the pretty charts, send an email saying "the last ad campaign you ran did not have a significant impact on sales or foot traffic".  That's all they want to know.</p>
<p>Maybe I should get a job at grafana.</p>
