<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted-ebook/dp/B00X47ZVXM">Deep Work</a> by Cal Newport is the book I have been reading for a while. Trying to finish this by the end of this month. I find reading both the ebook and listening to the audiobook is the best way for my brain to take in the information.</p>

<p>That's a great book.  Hard at times to execute in practice but it's a worthy ideal to strive for. I also read Slow Productivity but did not find that one to be as good as Deep Work.</p>

<p>I listened to it. Agreed. Nice book. If only I could be as productive as the author! <span aria-label="sweat smile" class="emoji emoji-1f605" role="img" title="sweat smile">:sweat_smile:</span></p>

<p>Currently, I'm about half way through the book, and my reading last night covered the 4 Disciplines of  Execution.  This ties into one of the main reasons I started this book, after two years of newborns I am trying to get back into my productivity. </p>
<h3>The 4DX Principle</h3>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the Wildly Important<ul>
<li>currently, I want to improve my reading habit. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Act on the Lead Measuers<ul>
<li>I have started tracking <strong>undistracted</strong> time reading, this is generally about 15-30 minutes (one Pomodoro was my previous goal) with <a href="https://www.kimai.org/">Kimai</a> my time tracking solution</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keep a Compelling Scorecard<ul>
<li>This one i am having a bit of trouble with, I don't know how to make completing a chapter/section/book more compelling. I used to try to treat myself to games, but found that a bit counter productive to what my goal is.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Create a Cadence of Accountability <ul>
<li>I am implementing a personal review, to take place every Sunday at 10:00, this also piggybacks off my GTD goals, and I am partially using this group as accontability.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>I read Deep Work a couple years ago, when I switched back to being an IC. Really liked it. For a while I was trying to do the "schedule each day in 30 min blocks" bit. It helped somewhat, but ultimately I'd ignore it, even though I did it daily... plus there are so many things that come up unexpectedly.</p>
<p>What I've started doing the last few weeks that is super helpful for me is just leaving my phone on the other side of my office. I can't even hear when it rings, and that's fine. Check it when I get up for water/restroom/etc. That's helped more than anything lol</p>
