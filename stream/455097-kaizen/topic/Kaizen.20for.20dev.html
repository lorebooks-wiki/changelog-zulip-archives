<p>First of all, let me say that while I enjoy many of the podcasts, the Kaizen episodes are my favorites and Gerhard's enthusiasm and sense of humor are a treat. </p>
<p>It'd be great if you're team, and especially <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755424">@Gerhard</span>, would elaborate more on your use of Kaizen for development and DevOps.  Most Kaizen coverage seems to be about manufacturing or using some piece of software. I haven't found a lot about using it in a dev team setting. </p>
<p>Maybe get Gerhard to do some blog post?</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="760631">@Al Gonzalez</span> I have exactly the same feelings. I try to channel my inner <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755424">@Gerhard</span> when I present my work. When it comes to kaizen I recommend Kim's Gen work (Pheonix Project, DevOps handbook and many more). The whole devops movement is very heavily inspired by Toyota, lean manufacturing, Andon Cord and dojos. Can't recommend giving them a read or a listen strongly enough!</p>

<p>Thank you, I really appreciate that!</p>
<p>Both books that <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="758534">@FlakM</span> recommended have been part of my library for many years now, highly recommended. Also worth exploring:</p>
<p><strong>The Goal</strong> by Eliyahu Goldratt is my favourite way of understanding the core principles. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)</a> . <strong>It's Not Luck</strong> is a great follow-up.</p>
<p>On YouTube, these are good places to continue your reasearch: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jez+humble">https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=jez+humble</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ContinuousDelivery">https://www.youtube.com/@ContinuousDelivery</a></p>
<p>And then there is a whole DORA world to explore: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_Research_and_Assessment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps_Research_and_Assessment</a> (note the Accelerate book) &amp; <a href="https://dora.dev/research/">https://dora.dev/research/</a></p>

<p>Thank you for the references. I'll look into them soon. I have to admit that I've seen DORA in some posts, but I haven't looked into it yet.</p>

<p>I finished The Phoenix Project this year and I highly recommend it! The first 3/4 is written like a novel but packed with theory sort of woven into the story which makes it a much easier read than a true factual book.</p>

<p>I had read The Phoenix Project a couple of years ago and read The Goal this year. It was really interesting to see the direct inspiration. The Goal was pretty great, and a quick read. I have trouble applying it to software development (as opposed to "IT operations" which Phoenix focuses on).</p>

<p>I read both several years ago and highly recommend them. Too bad that so many people nowadays think "devops" is knowing how to run a container on kubernetes or setting up a CI pipeline somewhere. It is so much more than that, and the lessons from that book and other people who tried to teach the world a better way to develop software, ended up lost. We're back to having "devops teams" which is exactly the opposite of what DevOps should be. Again, highly recommend both books.</p>

<p>Oof, I have found my people: folks that know DevOps is not a job title :D</p>

<p>For internal training, Atlassian used to run a "DevOps simulator"<br>
It would be a classroom of maybe 20 people, all divided into the 5-10 teams that perform critical business functions, from executive level all the way down to engineering and support</p>
<p>It sort of played out a little bit like the boardgame Diplomacy: each turn, each team would perform their function (these were little escape room like puzzles sort of inspired by the business function), and the results would be aggregated</p>
<p>The first run of the simulator would have no information sharing between teams, making certain puzzles harder to complete <br>
Then the second run of the game would have the DevOps-recommended sharing of information upstream and downstream from each team <br>
It'd be very obvious by the end that executives need information from support and engineering in order to perform their function, and vice versa</p>
<p>DevOps is an organisation-wide culture, and it fails just like Agile does if only some teams embrace it</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="771585">@Ron Waldon-Howe</span> that company-wide simulation sounds really interesting, is there any public info about it? I can't find much from a quick duck.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="752986">@Daniel Buckmaster</span> it wasn't Atlassian's own thing, it seemed like we hired or licenced it from some consultants, but nothing specific about them shows up when I search our internal stuff :S<br>
And none of the public search results for it looks familiar either, but they are in the ballpark<br>
