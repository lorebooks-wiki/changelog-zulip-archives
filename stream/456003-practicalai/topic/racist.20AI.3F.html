<p>X has been a Nazi bar for so long that this doesn't surprise me at all<br>
What does surprise me is that people who don't seem to be outwardly racist still have X accounts and still use X at all, and still buy Teslas, and still do so many things that enrich and empower Musk</p>

<p>I have been dipping into bluesky on and off but it seems really sleepy. Threads is very active but my feed was full of awful people who seem intent on making threads even worse than xitter. Having said that though I saw images from the gaza war there that you can't see anywhere else and will haunt me till the day I die.  Being faced with the harsh reality of life did a number on my mental well being and I had to shut it off.  Every day I think about the people in Gaza who can't shut it off and can't get away and it makes me so despondent and sad.</p>

<p>yeah, i guess not living under constant threat of death means i have the privilege to consider my supply chain and my associations and ponder their ethical stance<br>
can't really fault someone in a war zone for not knowing that using X has unintended negative consequences</p>

<p>I wasn't clear I guess. I saw those harrowing images on threads. I think they might have been via instagram.</p>
<p>I haven't been on xitter for a long time.</p>
