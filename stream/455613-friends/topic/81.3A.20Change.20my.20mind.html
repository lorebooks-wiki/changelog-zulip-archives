<p>Hi guys, really liked this episode!<br>
<span class="user-mention" data-user-id="750017">@Adam Stacoviak</span> I think you mentioned it would be cool to have a nice display with KVM built in. Take a look at the ProArt Display PA27JCV - they say it has KVM built in. I didn't really look into KVM thing, but it is a really cool 5K 27" display - nice pixel density <span aria-label="sunglasses" class="emoji emoji-1f60e" role="img" title="sunglasses">:sunglasses:</span>.</p>

<p>Finally finished this episode. I think <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="750170">@Jerod Santo</span> was straggling the line between customization and ricing. I agree that it's generally a waste of time to rice your setup instead of just using the dang thing. However, I think a lot of people don't take the 20% of time up front to learn the basics of the tools they are using. Then they complain on the internet that the tool "wasn't for them" or "sucks" and that they will "build a modern tool that's better". If you just spent even 5 minutes learning the tool you'd realize it doesn't suck and it does meet your needs.</p>

<p>Agreed that just using an expert's tools doesn't make you an expert yourself but the journey learning how the expert is using the tools and applying that to your workflow can make you an expert over time. I remember this in pool where having a $500 stick doesn't magically make you better at pool but once you're at a certain level of skill it does help. I can pick up a bar stick and beat most people in pool since I know the fundamentals well. Same thing with my profession. I can use <code>vi</code> without syntax highlighting and AI to edit files and put out good work if necessary but of course I'd rather use my normal setup. I'm not lost like some of the new people in this field that take the day off when ChatGPT is down.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>What are the dead horses here? To me the conversation was a back and forth on what things have you or have you not changed your mind about? Topics like tooling came up and the hosts answered from their perspectives but it's not like these topics are "solved" by any means. Every person has their own opinion on these topics and it's good to hear others to better refine yours. If I had to guess I'd say that you already formed your opinions on the topics discussed so you didn't find value in the discussion.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="750170">@Jerod Santo</span> regarding "slow down to go faster" you may have phrased it this way first but the Military has been saying "Slow is smooth, smooth is fast" for a very long time. I believe the origins of this phrase begins with the Latin "Festina Lente" used by the Roman Navy. Translates to "make haste slowly".  I haven't ever heard it applied to software development however.  So I'll give you the cred for that. <br>
Love your show guys, I tell all coders I know to check you guys out.<br>
(I should have looked at previous messages before posting this, I see i moved too slowly)</p>

<p>I remember being told to <em>"slow down to go fast"</em> last century in the context of learning to drive from my bro's dad, a truck driver among other careers. Read the following with a diesel-soaked mechanic version of Tintin's Captain Haddock not-for-company vocabulary.  <em>"You boys have your pedal down all the time, then have to brake and overcorrect. Your sister get's it right. Slow down going into the corner, then smoothly accelerate throughout the turn."</em> </p>
<p>In a similar vein: <em>"you dumb kids think the way to use four-wheel drive is to get off the highway, lock up the hubs and go for broke. The right way is to go down that back road until you get in a tight spot, then use four-by to get out and go home. What you're gonna do: not listen to me, get stuck way the hell out there, and walk out."</em>  </p>
<p>He nailed it. (Hella fun though, even with the 2,3, and 7 hour hikes depending on which event we're celebrating. Also expensive. Took me 5 years to pay off the 7hr one.)</p>
<p>The slow down to go fast refrain echoes through my mind recurringly still, in widely varying contexts. As does the other, though one could say the 4x4 one is an alternate phrasing of the 1st.</p>

<p>I've heard that before and dig it for sure, didn't realize it was a military thing!</p>
<p>I wasn't trying to claim I invented anything. If it came off that way on the pod, I miscommunicated. I was just slightly miffed that when I typed the exact phrase into DDG with quotes around it and everything, my post wasn't the first hit. Even when I added "software" or "development" key words.</p>

<p>Just an FYI that you can use forward slashes '/' or back slashes '\' in many contexts in Windows. This includes Explorer, PowerShell and command prompt (cmd). Of course, the output default is still back slash.</p>
