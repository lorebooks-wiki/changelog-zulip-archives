<p>I've found myself recently leaning a lot on DHH's framing of open source. That it's an exercise in gift giving. By building open source software you're giving a gift to the wider community and that should come with all the expectations of giving a gift in the physical world (it would be quite rude to get mad at someone for giving you a "lesser" gift as reciprocation for a gift you gave them).</p>
<p>From a business perspective there are real trade offs to making something open source. One of those is that you're not going to be able to capture the whole market  yourself. You will have competitors profiting off your work and that's just part of the deal. That said, there is a real chance that the total market would be much smaller if the project wasn't open source. As a business you're capturing part of a much larger market than would otherwise exist which is likely better than capturing the whole of a smaller market.</p>
