<p>20 minutes in and I’m already exhausted. AI and the energy crisis it’s creating isn’t something humanity needs to unite around when there are people starving, without medical care, or without homes. AI is so far down the priority list. Tack on the guests clear distaste for climate conservation and I have a hard time taking this person seriously. Listening to be aware of the conversation, but good lord is it painful to listen to.</p>

<p>Unfortunately climate change is one of those things that is not immediate but an existential threat. There will never be a day where it's the most important thing globally but it is the most important thing when people are dying from forrest fires, heat stroke, dehydration etc. It's just that those things happen to small pockets of people far away usually.</p>
<p>Having said all that according to most scientists I have spoken to it's probably already too late to do anything about it. I am likely too old to see the worst effects of it which is a blessing I guess.</p>

<p>Thanks for this episode, I think everyone in the community should listen to this one because climate change isn't something that is going away and neither is the energy crisis that is going to make things worse. Greg had some great points about how bureaucracy has stagnated rebuilding the transmission grid and production...meanwhile China is moving forward and progressing. There needs to be a balance between responsible energy production and going too far on the other end and never building. The genie in the AI bottle is out but it's certainly not worth destroying the planet for. These large companies that are centering their businesses around AI should still be held to account for their 2030 pledges...those conveniently went out the window when the gold rush started.  Folks are worried about SkyNet but it's more realistic that we'll just make the planet a really miserable place to live for the next 200 years via climate change and large swath of humanity is going to suffer because of it.</p>

<p>There's an easy — and happily, correct — answer to the "monkey-brained" idea of piping all the excess heat into space. Go to your cupboard and pull down your favorite insulated mug. If it's any good, the proper technical term for it is a "vacuum flask," being a reservoir for holding heat surrounded by insulating vacuum, with as little of a path as possible from the inside to the outside, allowing it to keep the heat inside for hours.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>People have this conception of space being cold, and in absolute terms, it is, but that's because the heat from the stars is highly diffuse, with vast voids between. If empty space was good at absorbing heat, space would be hot with all those stars burning for billions of years.</p>
<p>When the ISS is in the Earth's shadow, they have to run heaters, but when it is in direct sunlight, they have to run energy-intensive chillers to pump the resulting heat out.</p>

<p>Oh, and those "heaters" I spoke of? We normally call them "astronauts" and "experiments" and "equipment". The ISS is being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_Active_Thermal_Control_System">continuously cooled</a> by turning sunlight into energy to run the coolers.</p>
<p>If that doesn't look like a data center cold-aisle chiller to you, it should.</p>
<p>This leads me to my new favorite computer term: <a href="https://constructandcommission.com/crac-unit-vs-crah-unit/">CRAH unit</a>, pronounced "Cray", an excellent coincidence since <a href="https://enabledenergy.net/insights/the-saga-of-liquid-cooling/">they helped pioneer liquid cooling</a>.</p>

<p>I saw this jaw dropping story a while back <a href="https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/chinas-1km-solar-array-the-manhattan-project-of-energy">https://sustainabilitymag.com/articles/chinas-1km-solar-array-the-manhattan-project-of-energy</a></p>
<p>China is going full blast on renewables and space technology. By 2030 they will be the only country with a space station, they are constantly going back and forth to the moon while other nations struggle to land there, they will most likely have a mars return mission before the USA does, they have a goal of 200 GW of nuclear power by 2035, the country aims to have 80% of its total energy mix come from non-fossil fuel sources by 2060, and achieve a combined 1,200 GW of solar and wind capacity by 2030.</p>
<p>They have a goal of carbon neutrality by 2060.</p>
<p>Maybe they will hit their goals, maybe they won't. So far they have hit every milestone they published in their space program so it seems likely that they will. </p>
<p>The motivation behind all this is energy independence, they don't want to be reliant on the middle east or the USA or Europe for their energy. With that motivation in mind I think they have strong incentive to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>I found myself curious about applying the ISS solution to the Earth as a whole, in the style of Randall Munroe's "What If?"</p>
<p>The ISS radiators can remove a continuous 70 kW of heat energy.</p>
<p>It is not straightforward to calculate the effects of global warming in terms of kW, but one friendly AI here estimated it at 10¹² kW  across the Earth's surface. Assuming this gets us into the ballpark, we'll need about ten billion ISS radiators to zero out global warming.</p>
<p>And never mind how we're going to manufacture all that, lift it into space, power it all, and get the heat energy up there to be radiated away, because now we have a new problem: the total area of the panels, support structures, cabling, etc. will cover about 1% of the sky if evenly distributed. For the same reason Dyson spheres are unstable, it will likely have to be concentrated into a band oriented along the ecliptic, which is liable to increase the effective coverage enough to throw us into <strong>global cooling</strong> instead.</p>
<p>Good job, men, mission accomplished! Hope ya packed a set of thermal undies.</p>

<p>That's what happens when a countries and companies set long term goals instead of being focused on the next 4 years or the next quarter. The US used to be motivated to do those things but haven't in a long while.</p>

<p>Oh boy, I'm feeling very trepitatious about beginning this episode based on the discussion. I will get to it, but will need to book out some time with a stuff drink nearby it sounds like! I work in solar, and while I'm trying to "do my bit" for the climate, discussions about the wider energy sector feel very fraught.</p>

<p>Unrelatedly, we just went through an election here in Australia where the opposition (conservative) party brought a nonsense nuclear plan basically designed to stymie renewables, and were resoundingly rejected. So that was nice.</p>

<p>I think we can take more practical means to try and cool the earth. One example is simply painting the roofs of building and parking lots and such white. This would increase the albedo of the planet slightly and reflect more radiation to space. Due to melting ice albedo of the planet is reducing which is going to lead to a runaway effect if nothing is done.</p>
<p>One thing I noticed while flying in NZ is that more and more some crops are being covered by a white mesh fabric. I presume this is to protect them from birds or insects but again they would increase reflectivity of the planet if this was more widely practiced. </p>

<p>This episode's guest put domestic solar forth as his solution to the coming AI energy crisis. It's another facile idea: they can't afford to run data centers, so they'll bribe us all into giving up a portion of our homes for their benefit. Easy!</p>
<p>Here's a question for the guest: when the fans on the GPU box start making more than the 50 dB you claim in the episode, and your repair tech puts me off for the third time, is it a violation of my contract with you if I jam a pencil into the blades and thereby force the GPUs to clock down, lest they cook themselves?</p>
<p>Yeah, thought so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>using light material for parking lots and roads.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parking lots are a non-starter. There's a big problem with that: people have this annoying habit of blocking the albedo-increasing material from the sun with cars, left in place for hours and hours during the sunny hours.</p>
<p>I suppose we could try legislating white cars for everyone… <span aria-label="stuck out tongue wink" class="emoji emoji-1f61c" role="img" title="stuck out tongue wink">:stuck_out_tongue_wink:</span></p>
<p>Roads have a portion of that problem, but there's another more significant one: they aren't black solely because of the tar in the asphalt. Freshly laid asphalt soon becomes a dark gray from all that shed tire material, blown dirt, etc. White roads won't stay white.</p>

<p>This is one of those perfection is the enemy of good solutions. Yes parking lots have cars in them but not always full. yes roads will get darker but not be black. I have traveled in the USA and Turkey and most highways are light colored despite being heavily travelled.</p>
<p>As for power generation yea I think we do need to push all the buttons, nuclear, geothermal, wave, solar etc and also do it distributed as possible.</p>

<p>Ok I finally listened to this and man I had so many questions and got so infuriated it's not even funny.  I wish I was in the room where I could follow up some questions or challenge his assertions.  </p>
<p>the overall impression I got was that all this is such a colossal waste of money and human resources. Imagine spending this much money to end hunger, to educate every child, to end wars, to advance science, to tackle existential threats to humanity such as climate change. Instead we are training next word predictions and shuttling money between the richest and (IMHO) the worst people on the planet.</p>
<p>Also it's clear to me that China is to going to win this race no matter what route you take to AI. They have the energy, they have the grid, they are building renewables at a pace nobody even comes close to and their plans are ambitious.  The US is suffering from a serious brain drain problem in graduate schools because science funding has been gutted so the best of the best is fleeing overseas to do their research and to teach.  Rise of theocratic rule isn't going to help science much either.</p>

<p>BTW just for giggles I asked chatgpt the question:</p>
<p>how much solar panels do I need to generate 800 kw for 12 hours?</p>
<p>The answer was </p>
<p>So you'd need about <strong>3840 panels</strong> rated at 500W each.</p>
<p>Then I asked how big of a battery I would need to store that and it said</p>
<p>3 Tesla Megapack 2 units</p>
<p>Apparently a tesla megapack 2 unit costs about 1.5 millon dollars and anywhere between 100,000 to 200,000 install.</p>
<p>So I don't see how powering 2 GPUS 24 hours a day is going to be profitable especially if installed in 20 million homes.</p>

<p>Looks like I misheard him. It's not 800 kw, it's 1,800 watts. Let's redo...</p>
<p>I asked chatgpt to calculate battery and panels needed to provide 1,800 watts for 24 hours and to estimate costs.</p>
<p>It said I needed 26 panels and 54kw battery. It estimated the costs to be $33,000 including installation, inverter etc.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Funding for construction of [the] Abilene data center is a JV between Crusoe, Blue Owl and Primary Digital Infrastructure. Confirming that Softbank is not and has not been involved in the funding for its construction.</p>

<p>That article goes on to detail the lack of involvement from SoftBank or further commitments to other datacenters under the "Stargate" name.

TSMC had those on back order up for years, locking out most other fabs. Nvidia in turn had TSMC's capacity locked up, which was part of their moat in the GPU market.

<p>I worry about medical advice from an LLM, which technologically cannot possess knowledge and is only accidentally correct<br>
They are interesting for low-stakes content creation, and any use case where a subject matter expert will double-check the output<br>
But we're already seeing lawyers and doctors and police and other folks rely on LLM output with life and death stakes, so I guess that ship has sailed</p>

<p>Alphafold is not an LLM though. Neither was Watson. I have no doubt computing will play a major role in medicine including personalized medicine and preventive medicine. About ten years ago I worked for a major health organization in NZ and I predicted that in ten years a computer would be the personal doctor for millions of people and would do a better job than most doctors. Of course I also predicted self driving cars would take over in five so I was off on both predictions. I still believe those things though. Apple (or google) have more information about your health than your doctor does and is more up to date on the latest research. Your doctor sets a fifteen minute appointment with you and spends ten minutes of that trying to remember who you are. Your watch knows whether or not you have been limping and walking more slowly in the last week.</p>
<p>Anyway these systems are not LLMs though and I should say it's not as if Sam Altman is personally responsible for chatgpt.</p>

<p>For giggles I prepared a prompt dealing with a chronic issue I have.  I told the LLM my age, sex, height, weight, etc. I detailed all the blood test results, all the medications I take, all the procedures I went through etc. I then asked Gemini, Claude, Deepseek, qwen, Chatgpt, Gemini Deepresearch and chatgpt deepresearch to diagnose the problem and to provide treatment options.</p>
<p>They all basically came to the same conclusions which is to be expected given they were all trained on basically the same data. Google Gemini Deepresearch was the best one INMHO and it kindly offered to save the result as a google doc. </p>
<p>The point is that none of them somehow found some innovative cause or treatment. Maybe a human medical researcher can read their results and maybe that will spark some idea and maybe they will submit a proposal for a research and maybe it will get accepted and maybe they will do the research and maybe they will conduct trials and maybe after a decade or more there will be some treatment but I wouldn't credit the LLM or Sam Altman with that.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="764308">@valon-loshaj</span> I listen to several science based podcasts including those run by active scientists. They are all pulling their hair out because funding for research has been gutted by the Trump administration. They no longer have the funds to support their grad students, care for the animals, pay for equipment etc.  On top of that Trump has put severe restrictions on non white students coming from overseas. The majority of master and PHD level students as well as postdocs in the US are not white europeans.  </p>
<p>All the advances in LLMs, machine learning, etc came from grad students and they are still driven largely by grad students who are leaving academia to cash in. Grad students are looking to Europe and China and elsewhere to see if they can continue to do their research while being able to eat and pay for rent and school. Students from other countries are not applying to Harvard and UCLA and Stanford and Cornell and Columbia etc because American universities either can not or don't want to accept them and the climate even if they were accepted is hostile to them.</p>
<p>This is going to take a long to undo and is going to have profound effects.  If you don't believe me go listen to the scientists themselves.</p>

<p>So far everybody is using the terms AI and LLMs interchangeably. They are not the same. Alphago is not an LLM and neither is Alphafold or watson etc. I think we need to be careful about the technologies we are talking about before we make proclamations on what is going to happen or not.</p>
<p>I don't think LLMs will make medical or scientific breakthroughs because they are not programmed to synthesise information and come up with novel predictions or theories.  They can however read the papers and summarize results fairly well. They can even write papers which seem to pass the smell test even though the results are fake. I predict that instead of advancing they will actually hold back science because they will flood the preprints with garbage papers which will poison the well both for humans and llms. Literally enshittification of the scientific publishing world (which to be frank has already started).</p>

<p>Just getting to this now. First comment so far is that the guest made the common mistake of confusing watts with watt-hours when he said "8-12 watts per gallon" for desalination. Working in the field, I hear people do this all the time so I don't mean it as an indictment.</p>
<p>I tried to find what the real number was, and based on perusing the wiki article on desalination, which says current techniques take 2-3kWh/m^3 (with a theoretical lower bound of 1?) that seems about the right ballpark for 8-12 watt-hours per gallon.</p>
<p>I felt like commenting on this because a) I am a pendant and b) I feel like people who <em>do</em> know better need to be careful not to perpetuate the confusion. It means being that little extra bit careful with phrasing around this, <em>because</em> it can be so confusing.</p>

<p>Forgive me - way behind on podcasts... But I'm glad to see others having a similar reaction to what I had. I thought the deAI and some of the energy ideas were very interesting, but Greg was much more positive and bullish than I am. This is when I was sure that I was suspicious of his perspective - <a href="https://changelog.com/podcast/652#transcript-273">https://changelog.com/podcast/652#transcript-273</a>. Jerod brought up what I thought was a great point that got completely dismissed - of course there are theories on how things can improve, but are those even realistic goals in the near term? Unfortunately I think I have too many thoughts for just a Zulip message...</p>
<p>I think I see things differently due to having a background in economics. LLMs - since that's mostly what is being discussed - certainly have some value, but I think there is going to be a big bubble bursting here, but the timing is questionable since markets aren't always rational. The cost of infra acquisition and operation is astronomical for these things, and a proven business model is still questionable. If we end up with open source models, anyone can run the inference - and the AI focused companies will struggle to be recoup costs. If proprietary wins out, means of production become even more concentrated, which has huge implications for society. White collar tech-type jobs - which CEOs want to eliminate - were high paying, highly taxed, high consumption jobs. Getting rid of millions of these "good" jobs while our national debt is ballooning and safety nets are being gutted seems like a recipe for disaster. </p>
<p>Not to mention the energy implications that y'all touched on. US grids are very sensitive, and the expansion plans for data centers sound outlandish to me. But, I'm not an expert there at all <span aria-label="man shrugging" class="emoji emoji-1f937-200d-2642" role="img" title="man shrugging">:man_shrugging:</span></p>

<p>In principle I am not opposed to state owned (or partially owned) enterprises if it's done right.  In NZ we have them and we used to have more of them but a previous right government ended up selling them in order to raise money and promised to deliver a budget surplus as a result. We sold the shares but never got that surplus.</p>
<p>They make sense in a small country like NZ where there is very little competition and the consumer is at the mercy of giant corporations who often practice collusion to control prices.</p>
<p>The Intel deal is bonkers though. It's an hostile takeover of a struggling corporation which isn't going to save it.</p>

<p>NASA still doesn't have a director and they have laid off 25% of their employees. Their preliminary budget shows a more then 40% cut. They are abandoning very important projects which the scientific community has been working on for more than a decade and looking forward to immensely. </p>
<p>Graduate students and postdocs have been left without funding in almost every university in America. Some of them are hanging on via funding from other sources but most of them will have to abandon their research projects or try to find resources from elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>Things look dismal on the scientific front.</p>
<p>Dr. Sean Carrol on his podcast said something like  "it takes decades to build up a scientific infrastructure and only days to destroy it".  </p>
<p>Same could be said about a lot of things including nations and democracy itself.</p>

<p>Maybe I misunderstood something but when the guest started talking about residential electric, I was very confused. I have several 30+-amp devices on my home 100 amp service, often running together (air conditioner, dryer, stove, car charger). I'm aware I'm not an expert but I certainly got the vibe he wasn't either (or at least wasn't communicating those details well).

<p>Nuclear is more predictable and there has been a lot of innovation in the smaller, modular reactors but its exceedingly difficult to build nuclear generation in the US because of regulation and local pushback.  If we had better storage and transmission the need for alternative sources would be less of an issue. California in particular generates more via solar than they can use during parts of the day so they have to sometimes turn off production if they can't offload it to other regions as they don't have enough storage. Its really frustrating IMO that tech companies totally just threw out all of their carbon neutrality goals to chase after the AI boom without a plan to address clean energy production. Burning diesel to power data centers is not a sustainable long-term solution. Nobody wants to pause though, too much fear, too much greed and as usual not enough strategic thinking.</p>

<p>What's that saying "The greatest shortcoming of the human race is our inability to understand the exponential function".</p>
<p>One thing our monkey brain is horrible at dealing with is long term risk assessment. There are certain events which are catastrophic but unlikely and others which are likely but not catastrophic. We plan for the latter and ignore the former. For example  solar flares and meteor strikes. We know they will happen and yet we do nothing about them because it's unlikely to happen this year or the next.</p>
<p>Climate change is both catastrophic and is already happening so I guess there is a second category of risks we are ignoring. The "would require dismantling capitalism" kind.</p>

<p>I am beginning to think the doomsayers about AI ruining the world are right. My take is that this all started years ago when the twittter and facebook algorithms started warping societies. This not only continued but intensified over the years and seems relentlessly moving forward and ever increasing pace. </p>
<p>The threat is not AGI it's just the normal AI we use every day influencing billions of people to take to the streets, commit violence, elect authoritarians, dismantle their democracies etc.</p>

<p>I don't think social media warped society, it just accelerated the warping set in motion by insufficiently-regulated capitalism</p>

<p>I disagree. I think the role of the AI in herding people into echo chambers and then feeding them a constant flow of disinformation can't be underestimated.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755905">@Tim Uckun</span> you might want to check out this recent interview of Maria Ressa (journalist, author, Nobel prize winner). I know we typically stay away from politics and try to focus on tech here so I’ll leave it at that</p>
