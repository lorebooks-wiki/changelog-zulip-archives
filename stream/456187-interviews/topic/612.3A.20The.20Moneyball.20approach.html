<p>John Nunemaker joins us to share his new thesis for acquiring Rails based SaaS apps. He's early days on his next big thing called <a href="https://verygoodsoftware.company">Very Good Software</a> and recently acquired Fireside, a podcast hosting service started by Dan Benjamin. This comes after many years since John's <a href="https://changelog.com/founderstalk/79">acquisition of a lifetime</a> of Speakerdeck to GitHub, which laid the foundation for these moves.</p>

<p>Interesting approach. Would be great to re-visit John next year to hear how the plans are playing out.</p>

<p>This episode made me want to own my own business more than any other. Loved hearing John talk about finding businesses to buy... You don't hear about that as much as starting one from scratch.</p>
