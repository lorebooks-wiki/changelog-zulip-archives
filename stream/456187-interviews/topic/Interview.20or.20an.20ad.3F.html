<p>I am sure this is a fine line but at what point does an interview become an ad?</p>
<p>I am not talking about open source maintainers or anything like that but when you interview the CEO or CTO of a company and that interview centers around their product or service it starts to smell like product placement or just plain old advertising to me.</p>
<p>Not that these people don't have anything interesting to say but I think you guys should do your best to steer the conversation away from the product. Maybe talk about their personal history or whatever I don't know. </p>
<p>Anyway I ended the recent Beyang Liu episode prematurely because of this even though I am a user of cody and like it.  </p>
<p>Maybe it's just me.</p>

<p>Our interviews are never ads. In other words, you cannot pay us money to come on our shows. We only talk to/about things we are genuinely curious about.</p>

<p>I think the interesting thing to talk to Beyang Liu about is what they're doing at Sourcegraph and why. Not what shoes he's collecting or why he chooses to Uber vs buy a car. Ok those things would be cool topics too, but the point of the call for me was to explore the world of Sourcegraph and how we can reach these economies of scale as an industry.</p>

<p>It would have been an ad IF I was trying to have him convince me/you how to get started. I didn't even ask him how to get started or even insinuate that you should. Podcasts are still the MOST AUTHENTIC form of content out there. We MUST explore the platforms out there and WHY they exist. This episode was an example of just that. It was an honest conversation with no agenda.</p>

<p>You know an ad interview when you see one. And the Stackoverflow Podcast has a lot of that. But this podcast isn't one. </p>
<p>The Changelog Podcast priorities are different. I believe Jerod and Adam genuinely want to share what's best for developers with the spirit of open source.</p>
<p>Changelog podcast is highly underrated. It is the best tech podcast; "on Joe Rogan's level". Even their weekly news brief is golden. Not everything here is for everybody but there's something here for everyone.</p>

<p>Honestly, as a subscriber I wouldn’t mind getting the ad packs at the end. Wouldn’t necessarily listen to all, especially repeats, but I have found out about a few things worth trying through them. And doing an ad buy shows some bit of legitimacy in a business.</p>

<p>I listen to a lot of podcasts with authors as guests and, generally speaking, their goal for coming on the podcast is so that listeners buy their book. Yet those never feel like ads to me. If we draw a straight analogy to CEOs talking about their product, I mean clearly their goal (maybe not their only goal) is to get more users. But I agree with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="755905">@Tim Uckun</span> that there is a risk in those interviews to feel more like ads. So I think Adam has tough balance to strike. </p>
<p>At the same time though, since they literally aren’t paid advertisements, there’s nothing shady or misleading going on here. It just might be, as others have pointed out, that interviews about products might not be everyone’s cup of tea.</p>

<p>We've only had paid advertising for a century or so, so humans lived without it, and maybe we _could_ live without it again</p>

<p>If the ads, interviews, or whatever name we give it next keep Changelog going I'm all for it. I listen to an ad at least once and then if I never want to hear it again I just seek past it on the fly. There are people whose voice annoys me (sorry David at Retool) and companies I just have no interest in hearing about (sorry Notion) so I just skip those ads.</p>
<p>To me the format is fine. It's clearly delimited and doesn't feel so much like a shill for a product but rather just an overview of what the thing is and what it can do for you. Although there was that one (Sentry?) ad that just droned on and on to the point I was like okay we can stop now.</p>

<p>I guess what I'm really trying to say is I don't pay for ++ so I accept the ads as my form of here monetize me.</p>
